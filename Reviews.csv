1,2.2,My son just loves this place.  Weird that he'd ask to come here everytime we go grocery shopping (bribe) and not even care to go to Toys R Us.  Not complaining.   I'm not into little knick knacks,TaU4LmKW,3622
2,2.2,"We gave it a 9, so we will make that 5-, 4,5 stars.    To start with it's just beautiful and we lucked out to be outside, under the heater next to the roaring fireplace. The service could not have been better and thanks to our YELPing friends, we hardly needed a menu.   The Portugese clam soup was \souper\ though on the salty side. The pork belly was \off the hook\ and the steak tacos were tops too! We gave the dishes, 9, 9.5 and 9.5 respectivley.  Margaritas were awesome, Smokehouse and Pomogranite but it was a short glass.      It's been a long time since we had a solid 9. Thanks guys! Oh and the table guac is a must. PS if you get he bread pudding, get the sauce on the side. It's over the top sweet. My pancreas is running laps right now!",zA4l2dC7,1429
3,1.1,After three lunch visits I've come to the conclusion that this restaurant fares just ok in my book.  I'll probably be back,5GBeKl09,862
4,2.2,"What started out as a simple attempt to find a perfect birthday present turned into a life-long relationship with a fantastic jeweler. I wanted to get my fianc\u00e9 (girlfriend at that time) a simple diamond pendant necklace for her birthday and could not find anything that even came close to matching her style. I searched the internet for days and reluctantly went into a few jewelry stores hoping for the best, but expecting the worst. I, like most people [guys] out there, had a bad feeling in a few stores I went to. Pushy sales people looking for the upsale, and sky high prices. I was getting very discouraged about the process, but that all changed when I came to Hyde Park. The super friendly staff made everything easy for me. There was no pushy sales process or anyone trying to upsell me something I didn't want. They immediately offered me a bottle of water and started to talk to me like a real person. After a few minutes of speaking with a very lovely woman in the store she suggested we think about something custom. At first  I was thinking \here we go; this is where I am going to get stuck!\, but I was all wrong!!!We looked a few loose stones and I got a great education about diamonds. I went home later that night and did some research on the internet and found that the prices we as good, or better than any of the big online retailers. I could never get my head wrapped around buying a diamond online, sight unseen, and I am so glad that I found Hyde Park. In the end I have used Hyde Park to create a custom pendant diamond necklace that my fianc\u00e9 absolutely loves (it is perfect on her), and I also used Hyde Park to get the diamond for the engagement ring, as well as everything else to follow. Want to know what service is all about in the jewelry business, check out what Hyde Park did for me. I picked out an amazing diamond for the engagement ring (chose the loose stone again) but had no idea what kind of a ring my fianc\u00e9 would want. So Hyde Park said \how about we just put it in a classic Tiffany solitaire setting as a temporary setting and then after you give it to her, you can come back in together and pick out the perfect setting and wedding band set\. I was like, seriously?!! You can just do that???In the end Hyde Park will be my jeweler for life. They helped me create the perfect simple birthday present, and took that service all the way through doing a custom engagement ring and matching wedding band set. This is the jewelry store for any guy who wants great service, great prices, and like me, doesn't have the first clue about how to make the perfect decision. Just let Hyde Park take the stress out of it like they did for me!",g6kymJz8,1988

6,2.8,"A pricy place to grab a bite. The plating of the food is beautiful, but the portions are a little small for the money. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated, but I could barely hold a conversation over all the noise. I was taken aback at how loud it was. There was a DJ spinning as well and, to put it nicely, I wasn't a fan of his \skills\. The noise volume absolutely smothered the meal and destroyed the atmosphere for me.",HVyk59HI,4739

15,2.3,"The food was good.  The ambiance, the wine, the staff were all first rate.  Definitely a nice date place.   Went last night and the waitress did something which has actually never happened to me before in my life - got my entree order completely wrong.  I ordered the spaghetti with white clam sauce, my wife ordered the seafood ravioli.  She had a salad, I had the special appetizer, which was prosciutto with mozzarella (forgive my spelling).  The salad and prosciutto were very good, but not the best.  Then the entree's came out.  My wife's seafood ravioli was supposed to be filled with shrimp and crab meat, but definitely had a fishy aftertaste to it which I would never associate with either of those two shellfish.  We would give that a C.  But what was placed before me was ziti with grilled chicken.  The waitress handled the error with aplomb and the right amount of \trying to make it right\.  I tasted the dish, and I have to say I give it a B+, and didn't want to wait for them to prepare what I had actually ordered.The espresso and capuccino were both very good.",PmWmfOPJ,4997

17,2.6,Very much enjoyed the duck confit salad and ease of wine pairings by the waiter Edward,G5hEAMM7,4749
18,1.1,"I would give a zero star if I could.  We ordered a yasu roll asking for avocado on the side yesterday and our waitress (who was super nice) went and told the sushi chef and he agreed said ok... Well when he gave us out order... Guess what... There's avocado.  So I politely told our waitress and she went and told the chief and he starts arguing with her.  Then he came and said \you want Avocado on the side???\ I said \yes\ he says \you don't like avocado?\ I said o\ and he says \oh. Just take it out then\  what the heck?????? I've never heard of someone making a mistake on my order then telling me a simple \just take it out\  I'm such a picky eater that I don't even want avocado touching anything but my sister who was with me, LOVES avocado so that's why I asked for it to be on the side!!!!  To make matters worst, I asked him if I can have a knife so I can cut the roll in half and let me sister eat the side with avocado... He hands me a chop stick thing with a sharp edge.  Omg. I give up. I just can't take it anymore. Poor service. Instead of remaking the roll or giving us a 10% off our bill or something.Worst sushi place ever. It's because of places like this... Is why I hate trying new places!!!",cQtjTaSW,3942
19,4.1,"For those of you who fancy yourselves urban adventurers, if you find yourselves in the vicinity of 27th Ave. and Van Buren you could do a lot worse than Taqueria Guadalajara.  That may sound like damnation by faint praise, but it's really not.  What I mean to say is that at the end of the day I'd rather have a taco at Gallo Blanco, America's, or La Condesa.  But those places are playing in a whole other ballpark - hell, a whole other game - and they're catering to a whole other demographic than Taqueria Guadalajara is.I first heard about this place at a \taquiza\ first-birthday party that I attended in one of Phoenix's historic neighborhoods.  The kid's folks are lawyers, and I guess they wanted to bring a bit of authenticity to their Mexican-themed party (to compliment their custom-made robot shaped pi\u00f1ata - very authentic).  The Taqueria Guadalajara van was parked outside their house, and a very nice Mexican woman had set up a grill in the back yard and was making tacos to order - carne asada, al pastor, and carnitas - along with a full condiment bar.  It was pretty f'n cool.  I ate eight tacos, and was stuffed.  I thought the \taquiza\ was a brilliant idea, took their card, and told my girlfriend and her family about it.  They thought it was a great idea too, and thought it might be good for an upcoming party they'll be having at their house.  I decided to do some due diligence before I gave that idea my blessing.  I checked Taqueria Guadalajara's license with Maricopa County's Environmental Services Department (I often do this with restaurants, and that's how I knew about True Food Kitchen's critical health code violations a while back).  Taqueria Guadalajara had no red flags on their report.  Today, my girlfriend, her mother, and I sojourned down Van Buren to check out the actual digs.  The place was very clean and easy on the eyes in every sort of way.  As my lady said: \I shouldn't like these baby-poo colored walls, but I do.\  Among the three of us, we ordered four tacos al pastor, four carne asada tacos, two carnitas tacos, a quesadilla, two Diet Cokes and an horchata, and our bill was $21.00.  All the tacos were savory.  Nothing really stood-out about them, but then again, nothing about them was bad.  The condiment bar was fully-stocked with the typical Mexican taco-goodies (salsas, pickled carrots, radishes, onions, etc.).  The food was ready quickly, and we were served with a smile.  Overall, it was a very satisfying meal.As I said, I don't foresee myself making the trip to 27th Ave. and Van Buren for this stuff, but if you're in the neighborhood, you can stop by and expect a good experience.  If you're looking for someone to use for an authentic \taquiza\ at your place, look no further.",ltUQs85p,1944
20,1.2,"What's not to like (except maybe the high prices), but my friend took care of that. So no worries.I just spent the day sunning lazily around the pool and walking, yes, walking- the lazy river (I got tired of waiting for an available tube and decided the exercise would be good after that huge burger). We were treated to a live band playing a wonderful variety of tunes poolside all day.The Marriot Burger for lunch was delicious as were the curly fries (sweet potato fries would have made my lunch even more perfect, but I'm not complaining.). The waitress very kindly filled my large water container with Pepsi so I was able to sip on it for hours without needing a refill.After lunch I was treated to a delicious Marriot Rum concoction that came with coconut on the rim. Yummy, but with all that rum- why no buzz?My first thought after seeing the resort-like grounds and pools, was- \I'm crashing this place all summer long!\ That dream ended abruptly when pool attendant slapped a wristband on me and thanksed my friend for coming. You need to show your room key or club card. I couldn't have gotten in without my friend's Club pass. :-(Luckily for me, my friend promised me another visit so I'm counting the days until I laze the floating river again....um...you know what I meant.BTW- The line to invite me to go with you to the pool forms right here..... 1.",bSJaNvZs,1764

23,1.2,I really enjoyed this gem the one time myself and the man ventured here with friends. The parking is a little bit of a nightmare due to limited parking lots surrounded by a few establishments. We had to get tricksy and find a place to park on a side street and walk over. Not so bad though! The interior is modern,RWuRBBrg,4467
24,4.6,When you get the right server,tXRy6Pyf,2463
25,4.9,"3.5 stars.  I've read numerous glowing reviews about Noca, but my experience there was unfortunately disappointing.  At some point I'll give it one more try with hopes that last Saturday was an \off-night,\ but it won't be anytime soon.  I'm sure many of you die-hard Noca lovers are fuming right now, but this was genuinely a 3.5 star experience.Our server was polite but overly rushed all night, which eventually became uncomfortable.  I began with a \JR's Ripper 12\ cocktail (Citron Vodka, Pama Liqueur, Fresh Squeezed Grapefruit, Jalape\u00f1o Essence).  It took 15-20 minutes to receive the first drink, which is just silly, but it was a spectacular concoction.  I highly recommend the Ripper, it was refreshing and the essence of jalapeno did not make it spicy, just added a very unique background flavor.A significantly long amount of time passed yet again to take our dinner order, but luckily we were enjoying each other's company enough to not worry too much (yet).  I started with the Crudo Salmon, which was truly exceptional.  I have never had better quality salmon, and the preserved lemon & pine nut accompaniment were a perfect pairing. For my next course, I tried the Chitarra Pasta with Prawns.  Me: \Could you please recommend a wine for the Prawn Chitarra?\Rushed Server: \Red or White?\Me: \Hmm, I think white would be nice with the Prawns...\Rushed Server: \Pinot Noir.  I'll bring you one.\While I highly doubt she didn't know Pinot Noir was a red, I was annoyed that she didn't listen to me, didn't make eye contact, and didn't recommend a particular brand, just said \I'll bring you one\ and ran off.  It was a very good Pinot Noir though (of course it was- she brought me the most expensive by the glass.)My final course was the pork chop.  It was a huge, beautiful cut of meat, with the fatty edges just starting to crisp.  However it was cooked medium-rare, which I am aware is the proper, foodie-way to eat pork, but I do think it should have been mentioned to me upon ordering.  I am ok with medium to medium-well, but rare to medium-rare is just too much for me.  That little piggy was still slightly breathing.It was seared in foie gras and paired with a Dijon spaetzel which sounds simply divine, right?  But, there was too much going on- too much salt, too much seasoning, just too heavy in general.  The saltiness was borderline overpowering.The lag between courses was awkward- entrees took too long and the supplements came much too fast.  Speaking of the supplements, they were so-so.  One was a diced beet salad of sorts, but because the \supplement server\ was also so incredibly rushed he barely had time to mumble the full description.  I don't think he bothered to even attempt at describing the second supplement.The inattentive service and \pretty\ good food made for a 3.5 star evening.",oiCToS2U,2354
26,3.3,"I have tried on several occassions to find something good to say about this store and all I can say is \They carry Wise potato chips\.  Only place I have found in Phoenix where I can buy these.Now on the other hand, the management and cashiers are very rude to the customers.  They also are not knowledgeable about what they sell.  I had a question and they had to get one of their customers to help me.Last time I was in there was for a sale which I had received an email saying about 20% off sale starting that afternoon.  I called the store to verify this and was told it pertained to ALL merchandise.  When I checked out they did not give me this discount.  I complained and cashier had to call store manager who had to call the employee I had talked to earlier. It turned out to be a mess but they finally decided (begrudgingly) to give me my 20% off.  After I left the store I discovered they had lied and not deducted the discount and charged me the fulll amount.  I thought they would give me the discount on my credit card bill but just got my bill and there was no credit.  I called the HO and talked to customer service who then contined to argue with me about the discount.  She told me she would have her manager call me back but of course he has not.This whole corporation is filled with liars and rude people.I saw one woman who came into this store late one night in Dec when it was pouring rain.  She had pulled up close to the front entry and the security guard asked her to move her vehicle.  This woman was handicapped and all spaces were filled.   She asked if they could loan her an unbrella if she had to walk from the back of lot in the rain.  They refused even though they had many of them sitting in the front of the store.  She walked out and drove away.  Good for her!!!!My friend who worked at the HO was off for 16 weeks with an injury (Non work related) and the day she was released by her doctor to return to work was FIRED.This is not the type of business I wish to deal with any longer and ask all intelligent persons to do the same.As for my chips, I will get someone on the East Coast to send them to me.",Jnc0xUFh,1115
27,4.7,This place is soooooo good!!!!! They have a great selection of hummus. The village hummus (spicy one) is my favorite. Along with the grilled chicken salad. They have a good and sometimes cheap selection of flavored mojitos. I prefer the regular ones but they are all pretty delicious. There aren't too many places on Mill to just go and eat and not get caught with bar food or super greasy food so this is a great change of pace and the food is always good.,IwsWP6Yi,4526
28,4.7,"So Katie H. is pretty dead on with the atmosphere and the lack of conversation --  a tad dingy on the inside, and only one of the girls could speak decent English; however, I don't remember the last time I cared much about the decor in a nail salon or whether or not my technician wanted to carry on some BS chit chat.  You can have crappy art on the wall, and you can only say hello for all I care, as long as you do a good job.  I was a little bummed that I walked in right after 4 other people, which meant I was the girl waiting with her feet in luke-warm water for 30 minutes.  Honestly though, it was worth the wait.  I had the only male in the place, and he was so apologetic that I had to wait - I think he may have been even more particular based on that (?) who knows.  Either way, he did an awesome job.  I'm still admiring my nails and toes today (got them done yesterday) thinking \wow!\  I think what's even better than my fab Cajun Shrimp-colored nails is the fact that it only cost me $35 dollars for both the mani and the pedi.  Scottsdale is super expensive almost all around, but this nail place isn't gipping anyone on their service.  I'm excited to go back, and I'm crossing my fingers I get the guy again!FYI - they prefer tips in cash but will accept it on a debit.",ga60OmKn,2631
29,3,"As as straight guy who went to Charlie's to support his gay buddies, I have to say, this place really blows, and not in the fun way.I took my girlfriend with me, because well, I am straight. As soon as we hit the door the door guy throws a fit about her having a tiny purse with her. Maybe big enough for her phone, two credit cards and a stick of gum. And really, the reason behind this is pretty simple, Charile's doesn't want women there. As one of my gay friends said that night \girlfriend, equality goes both ways.\ If you want someone to be nice to you, or to stand up for you when they need you to, maybe you want to be nice to them from the onset. Just a thought...Was having a good time until some guy on the floor told my girlfriend she \better drag her tits off the dance floor before he made her leave it.' About then and there I lost my cool. I've never been so well treated by a drag queen trying to keep me from killing someone. Thankfully my girlfriend was smart enough not to point out who it was that said it, otherwise it would have been another sort of ending to that story.On the upside, the bartender Tony there is a master of the bar. Great drinks, funny as hell, and a great guy. I wish I could like this place, as a lot of my friends love to hang out there, but I don't think I will be going back any time soon.",kBw00VJw,2669
30,3.2,"Just ate here for the first time last night for my birthday dinner and it was PHENOMINAL!! I don't think I've ever had a meal with so many different flavors in every single course, all of which were perfectly balanced and blended together.  And my wife isn't usually one to try a lot of unique dishes like the ones featured at FnB, so she was a bit hesitant to even go here, but she absolutely loved everything - and that's saying a lot!We started off with the world-famous braised leeks, which were perfectly cooked (hard to do with leeks), and the combination of flavors with the egg and the mustard panko smothered in mozzarella (which they make themselves) was amazing. Then for the main course I got the pasta and my wife got the halibut, and we split a side order of the rutabaga (sadly, they were out of the spicy broccoli).  The pasta  - WOW!! It has so much going on with the bacon, chanterelles, tarragon and a wonderful creme fraiche-based sauce, that I couldn't decide what I liked best about it.  And the halibut w/cauliflower and chermoula was out of this world, and my wife liked it so much that all I got was a few small bites. And then we finished off the meal with two desserts.  The first was a few scoops of roasted banana ice cream sandwiched between two pizzeles with rum raisins and chocolate fudge. It was very good except for the fact that the ice cream was slightly bitter, which makes me think they either used bananas which weren't ripe enough or they didn't roast them long enough. But then again, I'm comparing it to my own roasted banana ice cream that I make which is out of this world, so I'm a tough critic when it comes to that. :) HINT: use 6-8 well-ripened bananas (showing just a few brown spots) chopped up and tossed with a mix of 3/4C brown sugar and 2T rum & 2T butter, roasted @ 325F for 25 mins, for every 2qt of ice cream.  The second dessert was a black walnut & pear cake with a side of creme fraiche whipped cream.  I don't think I've ever had black walnuts before, and the flavor is SO good and SO different than regular walnuts, and the subtle sweetness of the pears was a nice contrast.  I highly recommend it.All in all it was one of the best dining experience that I have ever had, and I have eaten at  lot of very nice restaurants including Le Jules Verne (at the top of the Eiffel Tower) and French Laundry (in Napa). And the prices were very reasonable for being such a quaint restaurant with such eclectic cuisine.  If this restaurant were located in a place like NYC, Napa, Paris or even a high-end shopping plaza in Scottsdale, you would easily pay $200-$300+ for this type of meal, but here in this small side-street gem of a restaurant our total bill came out to a mere $98 (not including drinks, tax or tip). I can't wait to come back again and try some new things since the menu is constantly changing according to the season. I also hope to stop by for one of their \Late Night Love\ events to try some of their unique one-off meals.",r8hjSQmu,1386

I got the platter, which included 3 pieces of fried chicken with gravy on the side, corn bread and 2 sides (waffle and collard greens).  I was defeated...   The portions were huge.  It was sooo good though.  It was great having the bottomless jar of drink.  I suggest the kool aid.Overall it was a great experience.  I met some nice people and had a very satisfying meal.

BUT...when I was told that a simple booster would cost $35 to $45 and I would have to pay an additional $50 plus for an exam--listen to his heart, look in his eyes, rectal temp (to prove he was healthy enough to receive the vaccine), I refused.  $85 for a booster shot that he's had several times is over-the-top appalling.

The menu suggests that crepes are large enough to share.  Not agreeing with that statement.   The portion is more along the lines of the \Hara Hachi Bu\ level (80% full in Japanese).

I must say I had a nice time here from the beginning to end. The server was courteous and prompt, the appetizer bread was surprisingly good, and the entrees were very tasty. I had the Surf and Turf, expecting the steak to be sub-par. I love steak, and this was excellent steak. Perfectly cooked and coupled with Lobster tails (2). I don't really dig on seafood, so this is a place I won't be frequenting, but I highly recommend and would gladly come back. I actually \sent my regards to the chef\, like a dork...",Q8SFnm1y,999
52,1.3,The most Amazing Croissants I've had outside of Paris. My husband and enjoyed omlettes with croissants.  We shared a Chocolate Croissant with coffee and savored every bite. I bought 2 more Chocolate Croissants to bring home for my daughters. Authentic French pastries and the staff is very kind. The best part,Be0vKN5S,3415
53,4.6,"Have only been here once before under too stressful of circumstances to remember, this trip to Olive and Ivy was fantastic. Usually going to lunch in Scottsdale is hit or miss with expectations, however today we had a lunch meeting scheduled for 11:30, I got a front row parking spot in front of the valet and had no problem being seated right away.Sticking to my lunch salad trend, I ordered the Curry Salad with Chicken and couldn't have asked for a more perfect dish on such a warm day. The portions were great, the lettuce cool and crisp and even the \handmade\ bread and pesto before complimented everything perfectly. The only gripe I would have, understanding it is a Fox Restaurant, was how almost unnatural the wait staff was with how rehearsed and methodical all interactions were. Even down to the correct usage of \I am well\ versus \I am good\ seemed a bit out of place, but not a big deal.",EcWsLSRw,1064

56,4.9,I would never recommend anyone to go this school. There online program sucks. There financial service sucks even more and the counselor will harass you,j9ShPaLi,3624
57,1.2,"Good food, okay service and nice ambience, but DEFINITELY not as good as Houstons!We had to check it out b/c we go to Houstons at least a couple times a month and heard that J Alexanders was just as good.  So we went, and *surprise*, they had the same menu items.  We ordered a few things that we generally order from Houstons & a couple of new menu  items.  Here are my thoughts:Smoked Salmon Appetizer:  This is our \absolute\ favorite item at Houstons and this one definitely did not measure up.  The presentation was identical being a slab of salmon & the crisp toasties, but the taste just wasn't there.  It wasn't as moist and the creamy tartar sauce was not included so we had to ask for it.  It was good, but not great.Chicken Caesar Salad:  The dressing was good but didn't have the garlicky punch as Houstons.  It was still tasty and the anchovies on the side were huge, tender, and moist.  Again, good but not great.Cheeseburger:  It was okay, but a little dry.  The onion rings were huge, but a little bready for me so I ended up stripping it off.  Mac & Cheese:  Delicious!  Definitely would go back for it!!To sum it up, this is a great place with good food but I'd definitely go back to Houstons.  I find the food to be much better there!",hWaUCtzA,1250

60,2.2,"Visited last night for the first time.  Wife and son liked it, I thought it was OK.  I deducted a star for lack or alcohol service.  I was really in the mood for a cold beer and ribs and Joe's doesn't serve any alcohol of any kind.  Food was excellent quality, but the sauce was rather bland.  There is a sauce bar where you can get some extra sauce with a little kick to it.It's a family place in the southeast valley which probably explains the o alcohol policy\ and bland preparation.  But, it's a nice place with good food if you don't mind iced tea with your ribs.",QDpnEFUr,1509

64,1.7,This place came highly recommended.  Perhaps my expectations were too high.They have a boring,K6mP5nxi,1528
65,2.8,This is the hottest new spot in Scottsdale. Its very chill which is just what old town was needing. They have great music and very nice staff. The best parts are the big wheel patrons can spin and the beer bongs! My only complaint is with security. The doorman seemed to be overwhelmed and it was frustrating getting in,VlGqVwGR,2417

67,1.8,"Wanted to love it...and I did! First and foremost, love the decor, love the vibe. Mid century vintage lighting, paired with an entire wall treatment made out of old cassette tapes...whats not to love? Killer music.We started with two ice cold no.89's and they hit the spot, very smooth, mild pear taste, perfect cocktail for a summer night. We also chose to sit inside.Our first item was the double dip, very good! I hate eggs, but I liked the Cobb dip anyway, it was that good. The posole salsa was delicious and my fave of the two, paired with the kettle chips it hit the spot.For our entrees we selected the mixed grain salad (excellent vegetarian option) and it was light, but substantial enough to be a meal. The orange basil dressing is fabulous without being too sweet. I also order a side of the house smoked salmon which was incredible, best I've had, my only complaint would be the portion size, very small, but maybe my opinion is skewed because I enjoyed it so much I wanted more...We also ordered the Porkwich which was very generously portioned! Holy smokes it was large, wasn't sure how it could be maneuvered to get a bite, but we managed and thoroughly enjoyed it! Here's a tip: once you have picked up the Porkwich, don't put it down! You wont be able to arrange it properly again :) Also opted for a side of mac & cheese, it was good, and a nice departure from typical \side\ offerings. Great staff from host to server! The only element missing from this picture are fabulous deserts...coming soon I hope?All and all great new spot, next time, and there will be a next time soon, we're sitting on the patio it looks fab :)",7iJUy7PY,650
68,3,My bf went to CIBO after hearing about it from one of our Phoenix-Native friends. We LOVED it! I read the reviews about it before we went to I was super excited to go. We went for an early dinner arriving at 545pm and it was already pretty full. After sitting for a bit we noticed a bunch of ppl sitting outside waiting for a table. This place gets packed! We sat outside to the left beside the big tree with white lights- super nice! Underneath a heat lamp (my fav). The reviews are true,nZ6AtbkM,1960

74,2.4,Hungry in Scotsdale and came across the Pink Pony. Very old timey and pretty groovy especially for this paticular area of Scotsdale. Overall the food wasn't bad for what you paid for. My boyfriend and I both had the Rib eye special for $18.00 bucks plenty of food and the drinks were cheap. I loved the decor it reminds me of what the Brown Derby would have looked like or at least what I saw on I Love Lucy except in a Baseball theme. They provide entertainment but unfortunatly we were there a bit early so none for us,idJ6RASj,4172

81,4.8,"Don't get me wrong, for the ASU community, it serves pho that will suffice and pass for pho but if you have a car and can go elsewhere, go elsewhere.  Don't get this place mixed up with the OTHER Pho Nhat located on Southern and Dobson across the street from MCC.  That other place is AWESOME.THIS  place is all about mis-hits and complete misses.  I've come here and have had pho which is ok and other times when the broth is so laden with salt and msg that I feel suicidal 4 hours later.  I really hate giving out 2 stars to an establishment but the pho I tried here recently really made me feel ill hours after I ate it and I would be doing all my fellow Yelpers a disservice if I didn't say anything.  The good: clean establishment, close to ASU, huge playful Disney characters painted on the wall that reference BBQ even though it's a pho house, lots of parking, tall ceiling and you don't feel claustrophobic inside.The bad: somewhat salty/msg laden broth, small basil leaves.There aren't many \bads\ but that broth was so bad it almost had me sawing away at my wrists with anything that was sharp.  I felt bloated yet dehydrated at the same time.  My eyes were super dry, the joints in my hands swollen, my mouth parched...  this place unfortunately deserves the 2 star rating of \Meh, I've experienced better.\  I almost gave it a one star rating but I've had stuff in the past that was decent so it gets another star.If you're feeling lucky, go check it out.  If you have the best pho of your life, try to extend that luck and buy a lottery ticket.",9v8vgyaZ,4605

83,4.9,"My family and I found Tryst Cafe after staring at it several times from the nearby Humble Pie's patio. We tried it out for the first time about six months ago and have been going back at least once a month ever since. There are SO many reasons I am giving it 5 stars, but since it's a restaurant, I will start with the food! It is fabulous. I have tried about 50% of the menu (breakfast and lunch/dinner), and have yet to find something that doesn't make my mouth smile and my tummy purr in contentment. The fact that most of the ingredients are organic or locally raised makes my conscious happy, too. The reason I am writing this review tonight, though, is the guacamole appetizer. Holy Guacamole! Fresh avocado, delicious pico de gallo served with little puffs of flour tortilla heaven that are as close to sopapillas as this native New Mexican has found outside of NM. I put it on my sacred \last meal list\ reserved for only my favorite foods. SO good! Other reasons I love Tryst so much: 1) Joanna, our regular server who is a burst of fun, knowledgable, honest, and so kind to our 2 year old daughter 2) unique beer and wine selection 3) locally owned and 4) background music that is just perfect and literally had us dancing in our chairs with our daughter tonight!  I highly recommend supporting this restaurant...you will not be disappointed!",08MIKQ1t,4866

88,4.1,Went with the lowest expectations and wasn't disappointed. Not a fan of buffets or of fried foods or fatty foods.  The clam chowder was ok. The salads were ok.  No alcohol here.  The hot fudge dispenser at the desert bar was empty.  I was buffeted about by annoying fat ill-mannered  mouth-breathing children rooting around  at the troughs unaccompanied by adults.  I think I now fully comprehend why it's called \buffet\.  I would rather have root canal than return to this place.,VwKUUrKp,831

91,3.5,"Our experience from start to finish lasted over 2 hours.  Needless to say, after an hour of waiting, I told my husband, \This place better be damn good.\  And it was.It must have been prom night, hence the long wait; however, seeing how they had so many benches for people to sit at while they waited to be called, they are probably busy every night.  The hostess even came up to us to see if we wanted anything to drink.  We weren't even charged for our iced tea.After an hour of waiting, we finally got seated and our server was nice, informative, and tended to our needs in a pretty timely fashion.  He didn't even mind that our 14 month old daughter kept tugging at his belt.  We ordered the honey mustard wings and sweet potato fries as starters and they were delicious.  The chicken wings were a little on the \too fried\ side but I think that's relative to your own palette.  The flavor was awesome.  The sweet potato fries was delectable.  Definitely tasted like they were using \fresh oil\ to fry the fries instead of \old oil\.  That's always a good thing.We ordered a 10\ Chicago style deep dish with sausage and pepperoni.  O.M.G.  That's all I can say about it!!  It was awesome!!  I could only eat one piece, however, b'c I was so full!  Our dishes definitely came out slow but our waiter did inform us of this beforehand so we weren't disappointed about it.  Besides, you can rush good pizza, right?!I don't know how busy they are any other time of the day but we got there around 4:30pm on a Friday and waited an hour to get seated.  I definitely recommend coming here to try out their food but if wait is a concern, make sure you call ahead to see if they are busy!I want to emphasize the really great service.  We were asked how our meal went, our waiter was really nice, and we were given a warm good-bye, too!!  Thanks for a great experience Oregano's!",KzGJuM6D,1637

96,4.6,I have been eating at this place now for about 5 years. I love how they created more  room since before it was too small and crowded. The lunch time rush is not for those in a hurry. You can expect to wait after you place your order on a weekday about 15-30 minutes before  you leave if you are doing a take-out order. The place does get packed but the hot and cold sandwiches that I have tried are awesome and full of flavor. The pasta salad is ok but nothing to write home about. If you are not in a hurry and can wait up to 30 mins for your to go order it is worth a try. If not stop by after 2pm when the lunch rush has already passed through.,t6komAP7,4471
97,3.2,I'd hate to waste a star on this place!I lived right outside of The French Quarter in New Orleans for 8 months. I remember the best of Cajun food and this place was far from what I remember. I'm not big on seafood but everyone at our table ordered a seafood dish and all were not happy with their entree.What did I order? I ordered a simple Chicken Po'boy sandwich. How can a Cajun restaurant get this wrong? This place did. The chicken was placed on bread that was hard. I expected the chicken to be smothered in BBQ sauce. Wrong! The sauce was on the side. The lettuce on the side of dish that was to be used in the sandwich was a bit on the brown side. The fries were cold. Yuck!Waitress was great. She was the best part of this dining experience. Never again.,GDVmYsqt,3270
98,4,"After reading all the positive reviews on Yelp, we decided to make a trip to Tempe to try the delicious chicken fingers.I am happy to report that the chicken fingers are delicious.  So are the waffle fries!  There is still a special if you're a new customer where you will get one extra finger free.  Alan recommended we use our extra finger to try a finger drenched in Buffalo Sauce (for no extra charge).We told him to pick our sauces so we tried all of them except for the bleu cheese and the ranch.  We even got to try Alan's newest creation, which he will call \G Sauce\ or \Solid Gold.\  He hasn't decided on a name yet, but I think it is great on fries and he concurs.  My favorite sauce was the \Famous Special Sauce\ and DH preferred the Buffalo.The only things we saw needed improvement were the tables needed wiping down and BOTH customer restrooms were Out of Order.  The food was great.  Alan was super friendly (and, being from Wrigleyville... he gets extra points in my book) and helpful.  One other fun thing about this place is they have small-sized family games like Connect 4 and Battleship for the customers to play.All in all, a great small business you should support!",UCTwCDMt,4446
99,1.9,"For being a Japanese-style \grill\, Yogis is pretty good. There are several 'bowls' available including a Chicken Katsu and many beef flavored inspirations. Yogis rice bowls are offered in brown or white rice. You can add a popular spicy sauce that really adds a kick. Definitely a good eat for lunch.The employees are very friendly and Michelle loves to smile. Yogis can customize orders to make them vegetarian or add a different sauce or ingredient. There is a pump for teriyaki sauce for those of you that like extra.Yogis sits near a competing restaurant but they always seem busy during lunch. There is limited outside seating but plenty of seating inside. The tables and dispensers for food and condiments are kept neat and clean.",SSWDj0s4,2497

103,1.2,"I've been here a couple of times with the most recent time being a month ago. The food is good and the lunch specials are great and economical. Complimentary chips and salsa while you wait for your order is also a plus. Some folks don't like the fact that the building is an old temple themed building, but personally I like it. I like the fact that it's the original Macayo's building from the 60's, but maybe I'm more of a purist. Would I prefer for it to be torn down and have a modern establishment with touch screen ordering and wi-fi and all that other technology? No. But that's just me. The staff is friendly and courteous, this is also a plus. It's preferable over rude or neutral tempered staff right? The waiter held a conversation with us concerning Obama's visit to Macayo's.For the \Mex & Match\ lunch special I ordered a cheese enchilada and chile relleno with a side of beans. The enchilada was very good and even the beans were very good, as simple as beans are. My only issue was the chile relleno. It didn't have much of a chile flavor to it, kinda bland. It tasted more like the sauce it was topped with. But don't hold this against Macayo's. These type of chile's spiciness and flavor are very random. I know this from my experience with eating them. One can be very flavorful and spicy and the next one can be bland. So, I'm not gonna hold that bland chile against Macayo's. If your wondering about price, I spent about $11.00 for this meal including the drink. My only issue with the service was the same waiter who conversed with us about Obama's visit, asked for a tip at the begging when he introduced himself. It sounded rehearsed and something to the effect of: \Hi my name is so-and-so, I am your waiter today, a small tip would be appreciated...etc.\ I don't like that. I was planning to leave a tip, and I'm sure most people leave one, so asking for a tip to me almost sounds like begging. Other than that, no problems. I plan future trips.",B5rX9lLH,454

On Cowboy Ciao, it's an appetizer called Cheeky Porky, and the pork cheek is served with corn cakes with aioli and micro greens.  The only miss was the air dried corn that was chewy like uncooked corn.  Decent sized cheek(s), so much so that i ordered this appetizer as a meal.  They also had Fever Tree ginger beer on the menu, which I love.   The \Cowboy\ part of Cowboy Ciao is evident in the decor and ambiance...wood everywhere, cheap-ish chandelier draped with beads.  Very friendly staff...there's an open window at the bar where watching the chefs prepare food kept me entertained.",HicN2tet,1044
108,4.9,"The best place for pho hands down. What are the most important factors in determining the worthiness of a pho restaurant? The clever use of \pho\ in the restaurant name? exa: What the pho? phoking good?- NOThe freshness of the bean sprouts, and herbs they give you?-NOThe Broth?-YES - This is the most important facet of pho, the broth pulls everything in the bowl together. Having said that the broth here is superb! Compared to other pho joints in the valley Khai Hoans broth is by far the most unique and best tasting. The broth is savory, with a deep flavor. It is not sweet or salty, it is perfectly balanced. This place is small and quaint, they let their food speak for itself. There selling point is in their pho. Springrolls- Good portions of meat in the spring rolls. Generous shrimp and pork cuts. The peanut sauce is thick and sprinkled with fresh grounded peanuts. Its the best peanut sauce in my opinion. The sauce attaches itself to the spring roll, unlike other pho joints where the sauce is watery and upon dipping, the rolls do not retain much sauce. Khai hoans peanut sauce is like glue, its great and I enjoy dipping the meets into the sauce!",Xfvta7bd,1704

The steak burgers are sooo tasty and they look homemade not your typical commercial patty. I went back and took a chance with the hot dog and it was good too. I love the grilled onion they put on it. I am not big on sweets but decided to try their frozen custard one time and I must say it was pretty damn good. Better than any ice cream I have ever tasted. I like the texture and consistency... It is very creamy and not too sweet. Oh and their fries... Can't get enough of them... I get them extra crispy and the seasoning they use it awesome. It's not just salt... Definitely a good place if you need a burger fix.I always use the drive through but the service is decent. Nothing special for a drive through. They have never got my order wrong.,OZjleGk3,4092

Michael responded to this e-mail by saying\Perfect got everythingthanksM ichael\  Please read below e-mails. In my conversation with Michael on Monday, March 16th I was told (and I confirmed again in the below e-mail) there would be VIP services including no cover and not waiting in line at clubs and the drivers were knowledgeable about the area clubs.  This service was not provided.  Furthermore, as I mentioned we could have taken the car/SUV hotel service or taxis if all we wanted to do was get from point A to point B.  Your website says \We pride ourselves in giving the best customer service to our clients\ not we get you from point A to point B.  I am also curious as to what your driver \tells you otherwise\ regarding our experience.   Our experience that night was not what was sold to me over the phone. We did not receive the services that Michael said we would receive.  I will ask again please kindly remove $44 from my bill.

As per the below e-mails and our conversation you informed me that your drivers were knowledgeable about the clubs and places to go in Scottsdale and we would receive VIP services such as not having to wait in line or pay cover at clubs. I would like to start by saying this is not a complaint about Abel as he was a very friendly person but was not well trained and did not perform the services as we had discussed.  To start he was waiting to pick us up at Trader Vics Restaurant, not Hotel Valley Ho as stated in the below e-mail.  When the car did roll around one head light was out.  When we got in the car we asked for him to play some music, all the presets on the radio were static.  Being from out of town we did not know what radio stations to ask for.  We asked him to take us to the Mondrian Hotel and he did not know what or where that was, this was the same response when we asked him to take us to the W hotel.  These are both well known hotels with popular bars inside and I as per our discussion I would expect that the driver would know these locations.  We did not receive any special treatment as we had to wait in lines at both places.   When our 4 hours was up I told him thank you and we would not be needing the car anymore that night.  He informed me I would be charged for 6 hours.  As per my below e-mail, I reserved the car for 4 hours with the option for 6 hours.  (I believe he did change it to 4 hours).   Please send to me either via e-mail or fax to 213-489-1047 a break down of the charges to my credit card.   I had already been charged a $100 fee to hold the reservation, I see I was charged another $164 on 4/19.  My friends and I are very disappointed with the service we received as we could have just used the car/SUV service available to us at the hotel for much less money.  We paid a premium expecting great customer service and not having to wait in line at clubs.  I kindly ask that you reimburse my credit card $44 as I only agreed to pay $55/hour and do not wish to leave a tip as the services were not carried out as we discussed.   I appreciate your prompt attenti",V2zUgYpN,1577
114,1.4,Went to Blue 32 Sports Grill yesterday with the family for dinner. Laura took care of us and did a great job being our server. We started the festivities off with the happy hour nachos which comes with ground beef,VsEVi6DW,1048
115,4.3,I definitely need to eat Vietnamese food more often.  I just got back from Pho Thanh and I am in  Pho afterglow.  My date and I ordered two bowls of Pho,KCW1vmF3,108
116,3.5,Came here for lunch while we were in town at about 1:30 p.m. on a Saturday.  The place was DEAD.  Like I'm talking we were one of three tables.  That usually scares me away from a place,Womjao3e,4428
117,2.8,Bragg's Pie Factory is a pretty amazing place.  Right in the heat of Grand Ave's eclectic art scene this former confection creation station is now a very cool,f5TfoAIl,1482
118,3.8,"My friend told me to try this place.  After describing the menu to me she added that this was a Jewish deli.  \Does that mean portions are huge?\ \Yes.\  And they are.This is a typical restaurant setting, with full service waiters, none of that order-at-the-counter nonsense.I was supposed to try the pastrami sandwich on challah, but after reading Wendy's Favorite I couldn't resist.  The sandwich I got had an insane amount of thinly sliced turkey, lettuce leaves, red onions and lite cranberry mayo on cracked whole wheat.  A very good sandwich in theory, but the turkey was incredibly dry.  This could have been fixed by adding more lite cranberry mayo, but the waitress was hard to get a hold of.  For $11.79 it should have been better. The sandwich came with a side and I opted for french fries.  These were some of the best fries I have ever had.  They were made with high quality potatoes (at least that's what my dining partner told me) and were thick, more like wedges than fries.  Spiced well and complimented the BBQ sauce that I asked for nicely.I also had a pancake.  It was thick, had a big diameter, but didn't taste as outstanding as I thought it would.  Good value for the price.As you walk in you see a cart full of day-old breads/bagels for decent prices.  If I ever ate food at home I would have bought some bread, but fortunately I don't have to worry about supplying food for my kitchen.",s6MpPAAg,72
119,3.8,"I have yet to find a better fish and chips this side of the Atlantic ocean. Pair it with a Guinness, and you'll be in heaven. Corned beef ain't bad either, although it's not particularly lean (yes, I know, it's an Irish restaurant!).Good for lunch meals (since it's usually not packed at lunch), as long as you plan on not being able to think very clearly for the rest of the day. ; )Update #1: I asked an Irish friend of mine for his \take\ on Rula Bula's. I didn't want to lead the Yelp community astray... He says it's the best Irish food in town! So, I guess you can take that to the bank.Update #2: A friend and I were dining at Rula Bula's when a patron behind us starting choking. I gave the heimlich a whirl, but not having the best upper body strength, stepped aside when the professional help arrived (first a very nice cook and then perhaps a manager?). Anyway, heimlich was successful, and everyone went home safe and sound (after eating the rest of the meal, of course). Hey, that's cool. I like eating at a place that's not afraid to save a life or two... Oh, the meal was good too ~ lamb stew for my friend and corned beef for me. ; )",V1T3c0um,431
120,3.6,My golf group decided to take me out to dinner as a reward for having them down to Scottsdale for our winter golf trip.  One of the guys wanted to go to Don and Charlie's so that's where we ended up.We got there fairly early on a Friday night,LFHmLlqw,4131
121,3.8,We stayed at The Buttes last year and really liked it. We were given a friendly welcome and everyone was so hospitable and helpful. We liked the layout of the room and it was very clean. The setting is beautiful. Nestled in what seems like a small mountainside (rocky),DeajdXMS,2143
122,1.3,The Habit had friendly service and was decently fast (I did come at 11 am before the rush),xuvHrbAi,1097

124,2.7,"Although I live close to the Sephora at Fashion Square, I think I might just have to make the drive to the new location at the Scottsdale Quarter instead! This Sephora is brand new and they did a great job of making it spacious, organized and customer service oriented. The biggest hassle for me was finding parking at the Quarter but once I did, I browsed through Sephora with ease. Upon entering, I was immediately greeted by a staffer who walked me to the area of the store I was searching for. I came to this location not only to check it out, but also before the Fashion Square one was out of some makeup I needed and they told me they wouldn't get more for another week! Luckily, this new Sephora didn't let me down! After finding the makeup I needed, I looked through the store. This is is definitely bigger than the Fashion Square location and it reminds me more of a Sephora you find in a \big city.\ I won't go too much more in depth because a Sephora is a Sephora, but they definitely did a good job organizing this store and I think this is just what the Scottsdale Quarter needed!",MgIpebXr,65
125,4.8,Let's get the most important piece of information out of the way first- the buttermilk donuts are outstanding! Order those,mX0YBIid,1265
126,4.1,I'm still conflicted about this place although I'm leaning towards digging it. My friend had a party last wknd there and booked out the back room (which you would never know it was there with it's sneaky bookshelf door) We had dinner there pretty early and at 630pm they were already out of a few items so that sucked. But the food that we did have? Amazeballs. They describe their food as contemporary tapas and that's exactly what it was-we noshed on pretty much everything they had-chicken lollipops,zUEkXU0m,408
127,1,They are still coming out with great unique flavors such as root beer,cSmbY4e3,2133

132,4.4,DO NOT GET GLASS HERE! I called this company a week in advance hoping they could fix my window. The repair man came over and dropped my old broken window. He made an effort to clean it up but when he left my dog managed to cut his foot on the shards of glass that was left. Out carpet even has blood stains. Anyways the repair man dropped another window in his truck so he told me he couldn't install my new window today cuz that was the last one. I asked if he could just come back to fix it because i was waiting for 4 hours for him. He didn't want to make the \long drive.\  I called the Glas Teks phone number hoping for some help or maybe a different repair man. The only thing they said was to wait till the next day. yeyy another night in the cold for me! I called a different local company and it was $20 cheaper. DONT GO THROUGH GLAS TEK!,UNQiRprJ,1836
133,1.7,"What the hell happened to this place?I used to love Chino Bandido... their wacky Mexican/Asian combos seemed to give me consistent mouth-gasms every time I'd go there. Within the past year or so however something changed, the staff went way downhill and the resulting food that comes out of the kitchen is a sad and pathetic shadow of what it used to be. Just to illustrate this point, I decided to give this place another shot a few weeks ago and upon walking in (the place was empty by the way) I was greeted with a \wassup' by the main kid at the register... nothing more than that... just \wassup\ with a look on his face like I was a rival gang member entering into hostile territory... not very welcoming to say the least. After ordering my combo dish 'to go'... I was treated to about a 15 minute wait, and while I was waiting the three kids working in the kitchen were rapping with each other. Some of the words coming from their mouths are probably too harsh to include in this review. It was obvious that they were paying no attention to my food that was cooking. It was so uncomfortable to be sitting there that long, staring at a group of clueless kids making fools out of themselves... I almost walked out without my food even though I had already paid; because let's be honest... the chance of this food being decent at this point was near zero in my mind. After my long wait, and being handed my bad of food by one of the delinquent-looking employees (who by the way didn't mutter a single word when giving me my dish or when I left)... I went home to uncover what horrors awaited me in that styrofoam container. Let me just tell you my friends, it was not pretty. It looked like someone had taken an ice cream scooper and just plopped a pile of beans on top of a soggy tortilla and rice... then put in on the floor and stepped on it. It was a mushy pile of greased up nothingness... no substance, just a poor excuse for a pile of food that could be mistaken for animal excrement.By no means should you go here, unless they revitalize this place or hire some new staff... so this is your warning; avoid the Chandler location like the plague!",5fD3uijM,4539
134,1.5,Ballo Blanco is fantastic!  Located within the hip Clarendon Hotel near downtown Phoenix,UkwSOzyh,1731
135,3.5,We came to San Felipe's Cantina on a Thursday night and they were offering some great drink specials. ALL drinks were half off - can't beat that! We wouldn't have known if they didn't tell us so I think they need to have some more advertising out front. The food was okay - our group ordered some chips & salsa and also an order of quesadillas. The salsa was alright - definitely fresh but I wasn't a fan of the pieces of corn in it but that's just a personal thing. The quesadilla was also pretty good but I felt like it was something I could make at home.Service was great - the bartenders always made sure that we were doing okay and asked if we needed more drinks. This is a solid spot for HH and it gets pretty packed late at night. There's also tons of tv's so you can catch a game!,gTAyjblz,2327
136,4.1,we walked in at 2:45 on a sunday and they still seated and served us even though we came 15 mins before closing..so no waiting like a lot of the people were complaining about (of course you're going to wait,Zu4dofEC,816
137,2.8,Most of the time the music is good,LPZJvB3U,4476
138,3,"I'm a fan of this station only because it is closest to where I live.  I hate that I have to go through this hassle for every vehicle I own every year - and worse, for my motorcycle and qauds - which always pass, but it means for me alone that is three trips a year.  And what is worse is that they cannot test the quads on the trailer, you have to take them off.  That is majorly stupid.  But I guess it's just the cost of living in maricopa county.Anyway, I had to get my truck tested most recently, so I pull up and the wait time is 13 minutes.  There is only one bay open for diesels, so that is my line.  After not moving for 15 minutes, they finally opened a second bay, and I got in that line so I could be next.  Another ten minutes passes and the bay clears.  I fire up the beast to move forward, and the testing guy stops me, explaining that his \manager\ told him that a vehicle that was out front would be backing in to test.  When I asked why didn't that vehicle have to wait like everybody else, his only answer was \my manager told me to do this.\  I think the manager was a weasel for making his tech deal with an impatient driver, but whatever.  He offered to let me cut in front of the guy next to me who had been waiting even longer than I, but I chose to suck it up and wait in my line.  He told me he would go as quickly as he could.ten minutes later, I was out with my pass.  MAJOR kudos to the very polite tech who pushed me through quickly, MAJOR jeers for the manager that \delegated\ his responsibility to deal with customers.I'm so looking forward to my other required tests - but glad there are techs that care enough to do a great job.",o4h7Cl90,179
139,2.4,"So Jamie and I returned, as planned, for Christmas Eve at Hula's. And, as expected, it was a cozy, perfect evening.Our server was friendly and helpful, when it came to my quandary over which new tiki drink to try(I settled on a Mai Tai, followed--after the food--by the Hawai'i 5-0. The Mai Tai was delightfully tart, while the 5-0 was fruity and refreshing.). We also got a chance to chat with the owner of Hula's, Dana, who was friendly and personable(also, seemingly the only business owner who actually reads Yelp reviews).As for food, we shared the whitefish ceviche(a lovely bite from the citrus juices, with a melt-in-your-mouth aspect added by the coconut juice, all accented by the brightness of fresh chopped onions, chili, and cilantro). We also ordered the spicy edamame again--what can I say? I'm addicted! Jamie loved his Cajun burger and totally cleared his plate of fries(\they were sooo perfectly crispy\), while I ordered a (giant, $1) bowl of rice.So, once again, Hula's has left us happy and wanting more!",SxiZbciq,4732
140,4,"If you are a hunter, get your hunting gear ready because this is the place for you! Devil's Martini North is an excellent Puma and Cougar hunting ground. This desert watering hole attracts these two populations in full force. Watching them interact in their natural habitat can be highly interesting, to say the least.Oh, and although they are in their natural habitat, these species are far from atural\ themselves. It seems as though many of them have had mutations and augmentations due to a disease called \lack of self-confidence\. This disease has spread rampantly throughout this 40+ female population, and male hunters of all kinds come to watch.Get my point? Devil's North is worthless. It's located in a North Scottsdale strip mall (near a Safeway nonetheless), sometimes they have a cover (they should pay you to come here) and what really cracks me up is that they have valet parking... yet there is an overabundance of spots since it's in a strip mall!The patrons here are laughable. You know those guys that wear men's shoes with a heel? They come here. And you know those 50+ women who think that they are a \sexier\ version of Samantha from Sex and The City? They come here too.There are two visually disgusting occurrences that I unfortunately witnessed here - both perfectly describe the atmosphere. The first was a group of 30+ women, dressed like sleaze balls with obvious plastic surgery enhancements on display, trying to act like strippers on the dancing platform, while their 50+ husbands with orange fake tans sat on the couches nearby watching them. PUKE. The second time, it was about 8pm and the music inside was bumping. No one was on the dance floor. Well, except for two highly intoxicated 20 something girls bumping and grinding on each other while making eyes at the male hunters watching them. DOUBLE PUKE. Some patrons here are so sad that that the people watching isn't even amusing. It's great that they have 2-4-1 drink specials but the drinks aren't anything special. I am embarrassed to admit this, but I have also eaten here as well. Don't do it. The service is average, nothing to write home about. I've waited ages for drinks/food when it's not even that packed.Oh, and this place is so \classy\ that you are not allowed to wear a baseball hat inside. Riiiiiight. Yet cougars dressed as whores are allowed to run rampant through this place? Methinks not. Pass on Devil's Martini North. Save yourself from visual torture (unless you are a hunter).",QnFBV7vH,4258
141,2,Huge fan! So happy there are several locations and the flavor and quality is consistent with each of them! The Mediterranean chicken salad is phenomenal....as in,25CWoNV1,4370
142,1.7,"Been going to Don and Charlie's for years now.  It's kind of a family tradition.  A sports hangout, you may see some players and coaches during the off season as Scottsdale is a big place for spring training.  (This delighted my single girlfriends who took every opportunity to flirt the entire time I visited with them).The bar is roomy and comfortable, with more than ample stools to accommodate my generous tush. Say hello to Shelley who is mi favorito bartender!  You are welcome to dine at the bar, but the dining room is much more comfortable, with a great deal of banquette seating-  which I adore.  I often have the veal chop, or a nice, big NY Strip.  Twice baked potatoes, creamed spinach......you know the routine in the \good old boys' steakhouse.\  The best part is the house made chopped chicken livers which are simply to die for.Valet service rounds out the numerous reasons to choose this place over others in the area.

But I wasn't really there to watch half-naked sweaty dudes embrace each other for the better part of 15 minutes, I was there to eat and drink and make inappropriate comments while the people I was with watched the fights. And I probably won't be back, because the eats sucked and while the drinks did what they were supposed to do, they didn't make up for the below average food and barely average service. I'm adding an extra star for the delightful mural they had in the Women's bathroom, my favorite part of which is now uploaded under \Photos\.  You're welcome.",ROoULwHe,522

Since it was already 9PM, instead of booking online, I called the hotel directly to see if I could swing a better deal (they certainly werent going to sell the room to someone else at that hour).The woman who answered the phone offered me a special price of $149.  When I informed her that I could get $119 online, she agreed to match it.  \but it's already 9pm and i know you have to give Hotels.com a cut, so can't you beat it?\  \I'm not allowed to do that\ she answered.  \OK, who is and can you get them on the phone?\ I responded.  I wasn't aware that I had made a joke, but she burst out in laughter.  End of story, I booked it online where I get reward points and Hawthorn has to pay the commission.The room was clean with 2 bedrooms, a living room, bathroom, 3 TVs, etc.  Free Wifi was key since I had a ton of work to do.  Breakfast in the morning was the standard way overcooked scrambled eggs, sausage, biscuits, and really, really bad coffee etc (strangely no butter..).  So why 2 stars?  Easy ...

148,1.5,Went in after a day of shopping with my mother. We walked into the bar side and decided we wanted to sit in the pew benches on the restaurant side instead. We ordered waters and sodas while munching on a side of chips. My mom got the chicken pot pie and loved the crust and the moist chicken. I got the Meat and Cheese. Although I wish the cheese was a bit more melty the sage pork sausage was great. The dipping gravy tasted of beer. Great addition. The music was fun and the bartender dancing to the music was fun.

While we didn't swing in at the time, I made a mental note to return. \One man's trash is another man's treasure\ is prominently featured as you enter. And a kaleidoscope of items surrounds you as you make your way through the store. Be it vintage, reclaimed or a recent find, MadMaxx will probably have something to pique your interest. In most cases, there are treasures aplenty to inspire and delight; in others, it could also be said one man's trash is still trash. I ended up buying a hookah for $30 and it will need some TLC, new hoses and bowl, but otherwise will end up being a great addition to my set (this makes the third hookah I've purchased since the beginning of the year). Overall, MadMaxx's is a great addition to the eclectic blend that make the fabric of M7.Closed Monday. Open 10:30-6:30 Tues-Sat. 12-5:30 Sun.",vjlwd0Cm,3752

The House of Rice carries predominantly Japanese foodstuffs and cookware but also has a strong showing in the Indonesian and oddly Dutch categories.Apparently the store started as mainly Japanese and then they added more Indonesian food.

With food worse than what is probably served in tent city, I am now reeling in horror at what may come tomorrow or even within the hour. You see, the \meats\ in both my and my gf's burros have got to be canned or canner quality, you know...Friskas. Seriously.

Pizza A Metro has quickly spiralled into a place where they'll take your money, but you are no longer \famiglia\...When it first opened, you were greeted by the owner, served hot, fresh, incredibly delicious food at an incredible price.  A family of four could eat a complete meal for under $25, and that was before the economy took the REAL nosedive.  Takeout was served fresh, no hassles, any way you wanted.  We took incredible pride in sharing Pizza A Metro with friends & family.Now, the prices have shot through the roof - our last order was a large pizza & two pastas...$40.  Whaaaaa?  We got take out, and even though it was promised in 15  min, when we got there in 15 it had been sitting, was cold & starting to congeal.  When we bit into a slice of our favorite pie - A CRIME!   Gristlely meat!  Stale veggies!  Old sauce!  Yucky crust!  Totally disappointing.  Two gloppy pasta dishes I seriously could have made at home didn't make it any better.  The only dish made at Pizza A Metro that is still worth the dough is the Carbonara - to die for.  Fresh, that is.My last (and final) trip, I watch a kitchen worker scratch his head then grab some cheese toss into a dish.  Thank goodness it wasn't my dish...or was it...Well, may we never talk of this again...Too bad...we miss you, Maura.  Hope Scottsdale is going well.  We miss you.",qCpP6IbM,1603

162,3.8,"I don't know why you'd come here without kids, unless you were just in town for a short period of time and trying to combine shopping and dinner with an old friend before you head back to the airport.  If you had kids, this would probably be great -- there's plenty to distract them -- animatronic animals and booming thunderstorms and drinks served in blinky rocket glasses.  You could probably even finish your overpriced meal and knock back a drink or two before the critters started actiing up.  You could even purchase a toy at the gift shop on the way in and hope to finish a dessert.  This will only cost you an arm and a leg, standard amusement park pricing.If you're just 2 ladeez trying to catch up, this is probably not your venue.  There are kids and families all around -- happily, their ruckus won't be too annoying because all you can hear are jungle sounds and thunderstorms.  For a \save the animals\ themed place, there sure was a lot of meat on the menu.  The only veggie options were cheez sticks or a veggie burger.  I guess I could've gotten the shrimp pasta sans shrimp, but I balked at the $17 price tag.I did like sitting next to the enormous fish tank and having them peer at the progress of my dinner.  I was just glad I wasn't eating one of their pals.  I don't think I could've handled the bug-eyed gaping.",r8DzdWia,3067

The good beer wasn't on special at all, and their \domestic\ beers were all pretty much the crap I won't drink.  They also don't have a beer list to offer, so you had to try and remember everything the waiter said. The service was good, and friendly, and the food was decent, and not too expensive.One way I judge a happy hour is by how long we are there for, and this never turned in to happy hours.I'd need a special or something really compelling to go back.",x3efUknb,2316

That liquid is then added to  the restaurant's soup which is revered as the best soup in the word.  Limit 1 bowl per person...?NOCA must have gotten their hands on this relic.  Honestly.

I ordered the California Eggs Benedict (can't remember if that's what it was actually called, but there's only two on the menu and it wasn't the traditional one). HOLY MOLY that ish was delish. Legit might be one of the best benny's I've ever had. I asked the server if they had wheat English Muffins and she said no, just homemade. \Just Homemade\ - best English muffins hands down. I don't even wanna think how it contributed to my own muffin...muffin top that is. Anyhoo, we came back here again the next day for breakfast. I didn't wanna be the freak that orders the same thing twice so I ordered the special...breakfast veggie quesadilla. It was good. For sure good. But it wasn't the benny. However, this time around I decided to go with Bloody Mary Bar. GREAT choice. Fantastic choice. It was only $5 and they have a great selection of items to build your own bloody and I'm not gonna lie, I made a damn fine drink. I love me some good breakfast joints and this might be up there as one of my new favs. I think I'll just be the freak that always orders the same thing. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

And even though I'm close to senility, I eventually realized that it wasn't me!Our server was uninterested in this turn of events (when I let her know what was happening)...apparently I'm past the age when a 22 year old \model\ (who happens to be slingin' hash) needs to pay any attention to me...even when they are theoretically being paid to do so!Maybe she wasn't being paid enough to listen to me...that's probably why some hookers get $2-3,000 an hour...to listen...bareback.At any rate, I was going to add a star to my review, since the warm air enema felt so darn nice, but what other restaurant can compete with that?It wouldn't be fair!TBC is clearly a club that doesn't need me as a member, and I'm OK with that.",zSZBZ35u,3247

Like others had mentioned, it was so should-to-shoulder crowded that you really couldn't see much of anything among the masses of people in a small area.(I begged DH if we could PLEASE go on a Sunday instead...esp during football, oops! What was I thinking to make that suggestion???)The parking was horrible.Didn't see much chocolate (I can just go to Cerrata's or See's anytime without fighting a huge crowd of people). Of what I could see, there were various vendors in the Mad Hatter parking lot (maybe they signed up with the Mad Hatter and not the city) that were selling some vintage stuff, collectibles, artsy stuff, crafts, etc. The crowd was just too dense near the main area to get to the vendor tents - Velma Teague Library. I only managed to buy a bag of Kettle Corn before leaving.There were food vendors and a inflatable jumping thing....and hundreds of people. Why doesn't the city spread the festival down many blocked off streets, instead of containing it to one small area of the library lawn for hundreds of people to gather? Poorly planned.Unless you are the type of person who relishes shopping on Black Friday or you like to visit Disneyland during the most busiest time of the year (Xmas break)...basically, my point is if you LOVE HUGE crowds, then you'll love this.If I want chocolate so badly, I'll just microwave some leftover Snickers bars from Halloween with a bowl of pretzels.",yDwVH1wn,292

188,1,"Where do I begin with this place...Typically, I dislike going to places where everyone is too young, and thusly avoid them and try to find a \mature\ crowd. Well, I found about as mature as I was going to ever get it at the Blue Martini. Whoa, honey...seriously, who let you out of the nursing home this late?! I was truly shocked, most of the women here tonight were way beyond cougar status. And the men weren't too far off in age either. This place is not all that spacious. It was so packed tonight, and there wasn't much to really look at. Nothing stood out decor-wise, there isn't much of a dance floor, just small spots between the tables. There were about 3 bars, one near the stage, one near the back, and one out on the patio. I didn't go to the bathrooms, but I pretty much walked around the entire club. From the patio, you can look straight out onto the street, which isn't a bad view, but still nada much. Since I was here primarily for the White Party being thrown, I didn't drink. But my mom did...I'm so sorry I let her have that mojito ($12), one, because of the price, and two, her behavior to follow that drink. I was just standing around, minding my own business, to turn around and find my mother nowhere nearby, but talking to this handsome, muscular piece of chocolate (cue the drool). I'm like, what is she doing? Then she starts waving me to come over, still confused, I slowly approach her and Mr. Handsome. And what do I come to discover? My mother is asking this man to dance with me...MOM! Are you serious?!...I apologized like crazy to the guy, turns out, he was a woman's driver, and said he would totally dance with me if he wasn't on duty. His employer starts jokingly telling my mom to leave me be, and I could get my own men because I'm a beautiful young lady (Thank you). The lady hands me a card, turns out the woman is a PhD, that owns her own event planning organization, and says, I want you as one of my models, contact me. Wow, I'm officially model material, I feel so special! Slightly less embarrassed, I continued to stand about with my mom, while she laughed and made comments about the age of the crowd. The live entertainment was great, but all the music was from bands and musicians that were way before my time. ( clip of what was being played: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7xktwQXb6A&feature=player_profilepage )After spending about an entire hour trying to find a place for my mom to sit, I agreed to leaving this place.

I ordered the Kung Pao chicken which as filled with thick sauce which did blend the chicken and vegetable together, but more like made everything taste the same.  My wife had the eggplant chicken which I think tasted the same as the Kung Pao chicken as well.  Should have called it Kung Pao eggplant chicken.  The dinning room is similar to that of a lodge converted to restaurant.  I did order the sizzling rice soup which was good, but there wasn't enough soup as the rice soaked it all up.  Price was a little high for portion sizes I thought.  Although the owner was very nice and cordial that is the reason I gave this 2 stars.

It is a top pick for team lunches since it is right around the corner from my office building and they can easily accommodate a large group.

It is kind of a cool place with the funky western decor and the whole urban cowboy thing going on but I just really don't care for the food.  It is a pretty boring menu and overall they seem to choose quantity over quality and that just doesn't do it for me.So, why three stars you ask?  Well, I went here tonight for Happy Hour and actually had a pretty good time.  The appetizers were very tasty (quesadillas and onion rings for me) and everyone commented on how good the drinks were.  And everything was half price!  I got a giant size glass of Stella Artois (they have it on tap) so I was pretty happy.  The friendly bartender kept the party going with some free shots.  Albeit they were \girly\ ones, more sugar than alcohol, but hey we did all have to drive home after all.  Well, not me actually; fortunately, I car pool.",Y9kYkTtJ,3911

The small bread sticks that they serve you were just okay.  Not to flavorful and nothing to dip in accept plain olive oil.  The salad that came with the meal was large and the dressing good.I ordered the eggplant parmesean and didn't care for it.  It was like 6 very thinly cut pieces of eggplant dipped in egg and fried.

203,5,"After reading all the positive reviews on Yelp, we decided to give China King (or Blue Sky Seafood - translation of their Chinese name) a try. On the plus side, I have to say the servers were very eager - always asking us if there was anything else they could get us (though can't guarantee that they'd be equally attentive on a busy weekend).  While a couple of the dishes were solid (spare ribs, taro puff), the rest (including standards like \har gow\) fell short.  Overall the experience was disappointing.A big dim sum pet peeve of mine is lack of freshness.  Less than 10 seconds after we sat down, a steaming cart was pushed over from it's resting place to our table.  My question is how long has the cart been sitting around?  We'd find out soon enough.From the steam cart we ordered (all $1.95):- spare ribs in black bean sauce:  solid- \har gow\ (shrimp dumpling): dumpling skin was too thick, shrimp lacked crunch of freshness- chive & shrimp dumpling: skin stuck to the paper in the steamer indicating that it had been sitting around for a while- tripe with ginger and green onion: seasoning was overpoweringFrom the bake & deep-fry cart we ordered (all $1.95):- \ham sui gok\ (deep-fried glutinous rice balls filled with pork; interestingly, direct translation is salty water pastry) - this was completely soaked with oil- \wu gok\ (deep-fried taro filled with pork) - nice flaky \bird's-nest\exterior and tasty pork fillingIt was doubtful whether these were hot as they were just sitting on top of a cart with no heating element.  When we asked, the server offered to fetch us hot versions from the kitchen.  She came back very quickly so my guess is that these were sitting under heat lamps.When we overheard the server telling the neighboring table that their cheung fun (rice noodle with filling) would take a couple of minutes because the chef was stretching it (like pasta), we decided to order one too:- rice noodle filled with minced beef (same stuff as the beef ball) with a specially cooked soy sauce $2.95 - cheung fun was silky smooth but a bit on the oily sideIn addition, we also ordered poached kai lan (aka Chinese broccoli) $4.50 - generous plate of veg that's been par-boiled, tossed in oil and then drizzled with oyster sauce.  This was again too oily and the thick stems were not peeled as they should've been.For dessert, we had the steamed egg custard buns.  This was not on any of the carts but they will steam it to order when asked.  Our server warned us that it'd take 15 min.  Sadly, it wasn't worth the wait.  The skin of the buns were cracked - the dough was obviously not kneaded well enough for the gluten to hold it together.  The filling was more coconuty rather than eggy.If you're not too picky on your dim sum and China King is convenient for you, then we'd say give it a go.As for us, we'll continue to explore other dim sum options in Phoenix...and for a sure thing, we'd recommend China Chan on the Westside.",hTv7247c,1255

218,4.6,"Sweet \O\ is more like Sweet O\. Was intruiged by their website and good reviews, went on a wednesday afternoon around 430. We were the ONLY table. We ordered a two drinks, two sandwiches, and one dessert to share. The drinks were good, and the food had a lot of potential (although one sandwich was better than the other...) until I found a pretty gross hair embedded in the middle of my sandwich, mid-bite. Now, anyone who's worked food service can respect the occasional mistake. Sure, you cant control when your hair falls out. But what is getting the bad review from me is how BADLY the staff handled it. Upon notifying the waitress, she unapologetically stated \Well I have no idea how that could have possibly gotten in there\... Almost as if I placed it there. It was short, black, and still had skin connected to it. I don't have short black hair. So she took it away. She then asked if I would like something else, to which I asked if it were possible to make another half sandwich. She came out with a completely different sandwich than I ordered (which of course was the one I didn't care for). So I gave up on trying to get any more dinner and we focused on dessert. It was decent, but nothing I couldn'tve gotten at applebee's on happy hour. Then came the bill. Not a single thing had been comped, and it reached $60 dollars. When my friend complained, the waitress hastily said \I'll get the manager\. Manager comes bustling out, sets a new bill on the table, and walks off. I understand mistakes in food. I truely do. But the way this staff handled a mistake that was completely their own was ridiculous. Never ONCE in the evening did we get an \I'm sorry\ from any staff member.I won't be going back there again. And by the attitues they exhibited, It didn't appear as if they cared that I told anyone else not to go there either.2/19/08 EDIT: The owner has contacted me, apologized, and shared that there is new management.

In my humble opinion, it's too nice and well-lit to be a true 5 star dive-bar, but it has potential and here's why.... Parking:I've never had a problem finding a spot, as long as you can parallel park and read signs (WHERE NOT TO PARK), you'll be stellar.Dive Bar Essence:Check.  As soon as you enter the from the back-door (like every great dive bar/restaurant/etc.), you get smacked in your olfactory senses by the scent of beer, whiskey, a hint of puke and stale cigarette smoke.  The smell does vanish once you're halfway through the first beer.Smoking Section:Out front ( Don't enter from there and you will not have to fight through the wall of smoke.)  The door is opening so often that the aroma will waft in throughout the evening.  There are great fans & odor-eaters though.Beer Selection:Eclectic enough to be good for a few months/visits.  Wine Selection:Moderate.  No Joke, actual conversation with my friend Sara G. when we went here earlier this week:  \ ___ ____ is the sauvignon blanc?  Really?  We had that at Sushi Roku on our last visit.\  A dive bar that serves the same wine that a pretentious sushi joint in Scottsdale serves?  Priceless.Customer Service:This is a Dive Bar.  Don't expect people to be nice and cheery.Pool Table:Check.Music Selection:Pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance - This jukebox is the shit.

The flavors are okay...I liked the NSA flavor best, which is unusual when it comes to froyo. Most disappointing was the oatmeal cookie--my go-to flavor. It was WAYYYYY too sweet and had a slimy consistency after it quickly melted.  I think they were trying to outdo it with the cookie flavor and doubled up on ingredients. Not such a good outcome. My tummy didn't thank me. The toppings bar is expansive. Having the fruit placed before the candy is a perk. The staff act like they're too good to be working here. Even the guy who rang us up wouldn't make eye contact.  He scoffed at me when I said I was part of the loyalty program at another Yogurtology.

Fine it was supposed to have 3 live bands and I understand that we need to pay to see them. THe last band did not show up. WTF!!! they should have told me that at the door. The band that was playing was more interested in fornicating with one groupie that was there. We had to hear a whole monologue from each of the band memebers about how they deserved a dollar stuffed in their whiteys which was fine as long as they actually played a song but nooooo... we will not play until we get a dollar stuffed down our small weenies. \Then I will give a lap dance to the groupie and still not play\. Great!! and I had to be there to waste my time and money to observe this. Then I hear the last group ain't here. So I basically paid a cover charge to see drunk band members hit on groupies. And lets not talk about the turd they served me as bar food. The grilled chicken burger turned out to be raw and the soup was well... bleech....Why oh why do I subject myself to this mishandling... oh right I like dive bars, food joints etc.... because I believe mom and pop type establishments try their best to serve people well.....Paradigm shift with this establishment... service was apathetic.. food well.... grungy... and music..... blase....Truly a disappointment to my core beliefs",HYuELFre,3083

I used to live in the area for about 4 years before moving back to the midwest and Greekfest was a place I could come to, to treat myself for any celebration I deemed necessary. My wife and I had our first \business date\ here and the rest is history. We were in the early planning stages with Susan to have our wedding here, but certain circumstances had everything move to the east coast. On my first visit here back in 2006, my parents and I learned that Tony brought all his herbs from Greece and transplanted them here. You can taste the difference in the food and realize that this is not your run of the mill Greek restaurant you can find just about anywhere in the US. Tony thought about the texture and taste to each dish on the menu. I believe I have just had about everything on the menu during my 4 year residence there and everything had a unique and distinct taste from the last meal. My Yiayia always used to make me, my brother and my cousins beautiful food and I always would set the standards by her TLC cooking. Tony, does the same. The amount of TLC he puts into his food is unmatchable.The decor and atmosphere of the restaurant is beautiful. We also learned on our first visit, that he brought back as much copper and tin items that he could when he immigrated over. The restaurant is beautifully decorated with the items and the white table cloths and walls bring you to the islands of the Agean sea. I could always feel transplated when I would step through the door.During your meal service from the exceptional serving staff, Susan makes the rounds to the each table getting to know everyone on a personal level. Over the four years, we have gotten to know each other as well as we could from those 5 minute conversations, but she is able to recall what we spoke of the last time. That is hard to find these days. Someone that listens.I wish this place much success and when I am back in Phoenix, I can not wait to give them another visit and feel like I am sitting in Yiayia's kitchen eating the food I grew up loving.By the way, ask for a bag of kourabedis before you leave ;).",w5nhLEJ2,4370

Are you kidding? She said it was a rule and it had something to do with being ready for walk in customers. I said I am a customer. I explained that I had my wife's food with me and I did not want to wait for the slices as sometimes it is not that quick and I didn't want her food to get cold. She then gave me another girl - who said the same thing - the manager Chris was out. I asked her to have him call me. No call back - and I called back twice for him and he was always out. I cannot believe that they would be so customer unfriendly and cannot believe they have some silly rule about not being able to order slices over the phone - I guess that includes cheese cake. That is ok ---- I went to Spinatos which is much better.

252,4.6,"(I made a mistake and posted this to another location, caught this as I was writing a followup, so I erased my original review, reposting it here, and am posting a followup, so sorry if it looks a bit weird. I promise I'll pay closer attention going forward!)How long has it been since I've felt more than \meh\ about a Subway? Cant remember, there was one in Gilbert that was OK, but other than that, my experience with them as a chain has been so-so and in Arizona mostly wretched. With one, \Worst in Class\ experience mixed in.But after a long day of having my life saved at Mayo Clinic, I was a tad peckish, and we decided on a sandwich. Driving through Fountain Hills we decided that giving Subway there would be a reasonable gamble.  This location w as a complete delight.CLEANSUPER CLEAN!Nice! I was greeted when I walked in, and the one women working behind the counter apologized and said she would be with me as soon as her current customer was finished.As I waited, I looked at the food in the bins behind the glass and .. they were all appetizing looking! This was a first in a decade or more for me! Nice, neat, this is a store that is run by someone with personal pride.When my turn came, my wife ordered a steak & cheese w/extra meat, and I went for a Spicy Italian extra meat and cheese. (Its a heck of a value, and for us, 2-3 meals per sandwich)My wife was happy with her food, I was struck by things that are missing everywhere else. I never want to be a hassle so don't ask for it, but this woman separated the slices of meat on my sandwich, which makes a big difference in the texture of the sandwich, and nobody does.All this, and the store was only staffed with one person is astounding. Sadly, labor costs are eternal, no matter the business.The toppings were crisp, and the service was spot on perfect, the place, immaculate.. yes, it's a Subway, but within the world of Subways.. it's Iron Chef Subway.And I respect that.If I get a hunger for it again, there is only one Subway that will do, I live 2 blocks from the worst sandwich shop we have ever eaten at which also happens to be a Subway. (and after a respectful letter of feedback , we never heard back from the owner) And to get to this one, we drive by countless subways and other places. But nothing beats the taste that comes from a restaurant run with personal pride, and a real aim towards excellence.As I reread this it sounds impossible, and like I'm going on to long about it, but please believe me, its because my expectations and experiences have been so extremely low about this chain, I would always have chosen McDonald's or some drive through  over Subway based on Arizona experiences! This location makes a value oriented sandwich the way it should be. I love a great sandwich, and will pay a pretty penny for one, Does this take the place of Duck and Decanter? Lets be real, no way, but, for a $5 Italian Spicy Sub? This Subway can be proud, Has ample parking, at least two nice staff folks (one lady was there working, another was just coming on)And even though I believed everything to be prefab, the ingredients were as fresh as could be, On recommendation, I tried spinach instead of lettuce on my sub and it really was a good flavor that worked very well.",eExFyJnI,99

While I didn't run in last year's event, it took place in Tempe and was a single loop of 6.2 miles. This year's race was in Downtown Phoenix and consisted of 2 laps of 3.1 miles each. The race was well organized and registration and number/t-shirt pick up was smooth and easy. The \timing chip\ pick up was also easy on the morning of the event. Still I can only give this event 3-stars, for the following reasons: Course Layout - I really don't like doing \laps\ and all I could think about as I came around the first loop was how I had to do the whole thing over again.  Ugh!Water - As I came around Mile 2, I made the mistake of grabbing a cup from the water station. It was possibly the most foul water I had ever tasted. I don't know what happened, but I know that I wasn't the only one who felt this way. I immediately wished I had just let myself get dehydrated.

Everybody assumes I would love this place because it has apple in the name and I really like apple themed things. But no. Ugh. Gross. Nothing on the menu is good and the prices aren't even cheap!! I can understand cheap prices for cheap food but the prices are the same as Chilis or TGI Fridays. Except they have good food.The service is always horrible.

The theater has 4 or 5 theater rows and 4 or 5 bar level tables and chairs in the back. In a small space they've really produced a good movie theater feel! Nice job!I wish they had hard liquor as this would be a great way to delineate it from the other nearby establishments (especially since it has the best chill atmosphere in the area).

I have had the guacamole and I thought it was fine but nothing so special it should be three times the price of guacamole anywhere else.The cheese plate, on the other hand, I'd say that's where it's at  - the cheese portions were fair and the grilled pan de yuca was warm, soft and delicious!The pozole was good but while I thought it was cute that the \heat\ came on the side (you add your own serrano and garnish) I would have liked more of the flavor to come from the kitchen. I actually have to say I did NOT like the mahi mahi tacos and it had nothing to do with the size (they ARE small - the tortillas can't be more than 4 inches in diameter but the filling portions are generous). It was the fat little fish sticks that served as the filling --  all I could taste was the batter! By my second taco, I was trying to pick the batter off and come the third - I just gave up and left it in hopes of enjoying dessert.Dessert was good - I had the churros on the recommendation of the many Yelp reviews I had read and they were OK. I actually preferred the fried bananas - more specifically, the peanut butter mousse that they were plated with! OK, I was going to give this place 2 stars but I'm going to round up to 3 with a caveat: For dinner, \Meh. I've experienced better.\ but for sharing a cheese plate, maybe some pozole, a couple margaritas or a romantic setting for dessert with a bottle of wine, it's \A-OK.\",9LelHxCd,4003

When you're hungry, there's nothing worse than 30-60 minute wait times, or a giant party of 15 people who arrive later than you do and they get to \squeeze in\. Although Matt's has just upgraded to a new, bigger space, this still isn't the type of restaurant that should be accommodating 15-person groups (AKA almost the entire dining area).We went here for my husband's birthday on a Friday morning. After waiting about 45 minutes, we were next on the list but got bumped to the uncomfortable street-facing counter seats, when at that very moment there were three empty two-top tables, completely set with silverware and everything. We asked if we could be seated there instead, but were turned down by the host, because they were being reserved for the aforementioned party. My husband was having trouble with knee pain that morning and the counter seats did not physically accommodate his needs, so we asked our waitress if there was anywhere else we could sit. Again, we were turned down. I was getting a little flustered, not the way you want to feel on your loved one's birthday. We considered leaving, even after we ordered our food. Eventually, they did allow us to sit at a two-top, which I appreciated.The food was the only redeeming quality, but again I was too flustered to truly enjoy it. I got the cheese omelette with hash browns. Very good, although hash browns were a greasy, mushy mess. My husband got a ham scramble of some kind. We had a side of rye toast, which was tasty. Beverages were served in cute little jam jars.PROS:Food, Decor, Charm, Ambience, Supporting a local endeavorCONS:The most hyper-inflated wait time and some of the worst seating options of any restaurant I've ever known.The take-out option sounds nice, and would eliminate a lot of my frustrations.",C8bwgw8b,655

I ordered yellow squash soup and half a grilled chicken club sandwich for $9 and my coworker order the beer battered fish and chips for $11. I think they were trolling for the fish and chasing the chicken 'cause almost 25 minutes had gone by before our order was brought to us.

I ordered this chicken shawarma too. This was very good, and that had me satisfied. I thought there was wayy too much romaine lettuce ( not native to a shawarma or a falafel sandwich). But other than that the food was interesting, and I just felt good eating it. She got the honey pasta, which was a little sweet for my liking, with chunky cuts of veggies.The servers are dressed in casuals, and you wouldn't know they were a server, until they asked you what you wanted to drink.

The entire evening was filled with moments in between:- Complimentary chips and salsa, too watery to those seeking Frito Lay's interpretation or Pico de Gallo, but not flavorful enough to satisfy those looking for legitimate salsa- Filet Portabella ($27): soft, succulent beef and a large portabella in a rich mushroom sauce, a yield of decidedly non-Mexican excellence- Camarones Escondidos ($19): unremarkable chicken, average shrimp, meek sauce- Monterrey plate ($13): moderately balanced spinach enchilada, a chicken enchilada with a deep, satisfying mole, and a third Veracruz enchilada that I've forgotten already- Crepes ($6): Apple, more French than Mexican, more sweet to a fault than enjoyable- \Mexican\ Brownie ($6): An overpoweringly excessively sugary heart attack brownie on a skillet with extra artery clogging brandy butter that was not a good caloric investmentThere are flashes of brilliance and enough options to placate the uninitiated but like most stealth chains has succumbed to not being able to please all its many masters simultaneously and has settled for being \alright.\ For mixed culinary company, you could do far worse so it defends its niche, but for a homogeneous party, keep looking.",RbDSJ3qs,4296

I now live in the surprise area but about every two months or so I go out of my way to China Garden for the yummy sesame chicken and teriyaki wings.  There sweet and sour pork is also something to be desired.  China Garden does Chinese food the way it was done in the late eighties and early nineties.  It's what I grew up knowing and came to love.  The sweet and sour pork has the wonderful breading and is left to soak in the sweet and sour sauce.  Chinese food by today's standards leaves me feeling bloated and disappointed so I pass it up more and more.   The only regret when I eat china garden is that it will be a while before I get to go back.The egg drop soup is also some of the best in the valley.

So I had not been back to this location for over six years -- how time flies!  The previous owners made crummy food, even though they are supposed to be cooking from tried and true, franchise recipes.  So after trying the old owners' food about three times we gave up on this location.  But this past weekend, my daughter wanted their garlic shrimp, so we order from them again.I ordered three plates, but my order was misinterpreted and we got four plates instead.  I paid for all four since we wanted to try the food again and Will assured me that I would not be disappointed.  Their kalbi short ribs and bbq chicken was very good, and my daughter said that her garlic shrimp was also very good.  The macaroni salad was \Hawaiian Style\ and good too.  We also had some beef teriyaki and that was mediocre at best -- the beef was too lean and tough, and the marinade was not very good.  If they soaked the beef in the kalbi sauce and made a bbq version of bulgogi, that would have been better.Prices are on the high side; not extremely high, but high.  Plates are about $9 each and the short rib plate is like $10.But I still give them four stars since their food is pretty good and I will be back.

All I have to do is pull up my car, and they bring everything to me (major OMGAWWW AWESOME factor for me ^.^)As for the call ahead seating, seriously folks?!? It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure this out. You have two options:1) Call Outback before you leave the house, tell them you have #_ folks coming to eat and you will be there in __ minutes. They put your name on the wait list. This is just a way of getting your name on the list a little earlier.or2) You arrive at Outback with #_ folks and say \Hi, we're here to get our grub on\ and they put your name on the wait list and you get to sit there and wait as the folks who arrived after you (but called in their party onto the list, ahead of their arrival) get seated before you.Again, not rocket science.

339,2.1,"I'm a lifelong duck pond fan, so when I found out this was a restaurant centered around a pond, of course I couldn't resist.We were in town visiting my parents and dragged them there. They were good sports. The food was just okay... I'm certain there is much more authentic Mexican around, and probably for cheaper. But for ambiance this place is unequaled. The positive: Ambiance -- Beautiful outdoor seating alongside the pond, which had lots of feathered friends. Indoor seating all seems to have a good view of the pond as well. A great place to hold a function.The negative:There were quite a few blunders... Three of us got our food while my mom sat and waited... and waited. She probably had to wait 10 minutes, which got quite frustrating. Meanwhile, my boyfriend and I took the first sips of our \diet\ coke and both gave each other a weird look. \Does this taste strange to you?\ \Yes\ \Me too\ ... waitress comes, insists she poured diet, but brings back a new pitcher. Well would you believe that, this one actually tastes like diet! Beyond these blunders, this place is the only Mexican restaurant I have ever been to that charges extra if you go through your first basket of tortilla chips and decide you want more! The salsas that come with the chips were pretty good, but the guac we ordered was not so good (kinda bland tasty and mushy). It came with a small pile of chips on the side. Seemed like they were teasing with just enough chips to get you to want more, so you'd have to pay extra.The bottom line: Great if you have a group and want a fun setting or are dining with kids and want them to be able to enjoy the duck pond. Don't go for the food. And I wouldn't go often. But for a cool one-time experience definitely worth it.",XYm86Fw4,4192

341,4.2,"We went to North last Sunday night.  We were a party of five, and arrived at 8 pm.  The restaurant was not at all busy.    We ordered a fairly routine set of food:  the scallops, a couple of grilled artichokes, a salad, the special, and a thin crust pizza.  We didn't order appetizers, and we ordered by 8.10.  A LONG time elapses.  At about the 8.35 mark, our waiter says that the food will be out in a minute.  He has never offered us any bread, nor does he offer additional beverages.  We did have a (small) ramekin of olives to tide us over.  About ten minutes later, he comes by again, assuring us that the food will be out \soon\.  I ask if there is a problem, and he looks surprised:  problem, what could be the problem.  However, at this point (about 45 minutes after we've arrived) he realizes that he has bread to offer, and brings over a fairly stale loaf of white bread and their spread.  Finally, at a few minutes after nine, the food begins to appear.  The food is okay, but not great.  No apology is ever tendered for the lengthy delay, and to add insult to injury, the waiter never returns to ask if we want dessert, or want the check.  Finally, a member of our party tracked him down with credit card in hand so that we could leave. There really is no excuse for this type of service.  If you are having a problem in the kitchen, come over, explain that there's a delay and bring a round of drinks or an appetizer.

First, the ballpark seems to be out in the middle of no where and I found it slightly strange the seemingly abandoned planes adjacent. Okay. Traveling in there were slight detour signs and lots of cones. My first impression is that there was a lot of traveling around and that it was so new that they are still working out the \bugs\.Parking = $5 = SUCKS!! Normally you can park around stadiums for free if you are crafty, but there didn't seem to be any alternatives close by. As I wanted to get it to the game I just paid it. One thing that was weird about the parking \lot\ was that it was grass. I have my thoughts, but sort of cool. Walking up be prepared to wait in the ticket line. There were only a handful of ticket windows and they were running a tad slow. My friend and I went prepared to buy the lowest ticket, which was $8. We were then told at the counter they were running a outfield reserve for $6. We jumped on it. Our seat were 3 rows back on the 3rd base side. AWESOME! The stadium itself was sort of modern looking. Lots of metal and urban looking. I am not sure if I like it, but it was new, big, lots of shade and green! There is a huge grass picnic area with some tables and room to play catch. Food price is the same, beer prices are the same as everywhere else. Total cost for ticket, beer, parking, soda and hot dog was $24. Not bad. I will go here again simply for the fact that it is new. Far for me, but could be close to you.",78GEAsWz,4132

Could've gone without the \Magician\ I felt like coming down with a case of Tourette's syndrome!!  the Cosmo was interesting, weird glass! The food was awesome, shrimp boat was quite interesting, the scallops was to die for!! Desert was quite interesting. Apple Crumb pie with Ice cream, Too much to finish.

346,4.8,"I was here...  you guessed it.. Saturday night. I have been drooling/dreaming about/over the pictures of their cheese plates and bruschetta since frequenting yelp. Every weekend I would put off going swearing I would get there next time. I finally made it and was absolutely not disappointed.I tend to stay away from super trendy places as my cheat meals generally include at least two places and a small time window. The wait is usually really long and although the service is usually good the food wait time is usually up there.I came fully prepared to wait for a while and for mediocre to bad service based on the reviews I've read. I was pleasantly surprised on both topics. We were instantly greeted at the door by a very nice/enthusiastic hostess. She apologized that they couldn't seat us right away and helped us find a comfortable place to stand and wait for a table. The wait was about 15-20 minutes. Fearing the service I had read about I was keeping an eye for open tables. One opened and the hostess quickly cleared it and was showing us to our seat within a few moments of the table freeing up.Our waitress was at our table asking about drinks within 2 minutes of sitting down. We ordered and drinks and appetizers right away. One of the apps hit the table within 5 minutes. The only complaint I have is that it was another 5 before the rest came out. Better to serve it all at once.In summary the service was GREAT. Total opposite of what I prepared myself for.Onto the Food:\The Plate\:An assortment of artisan meats and cheeses served with tuscan beans, olives, nuts and crostini. Absolutely delicious. There was a huge variety of olives. The goat cheese was a little ripe for my liking but that's just a personal thing. The dish needs to be served with a little more bread then was provided.Bruschetta:Brie & Apples with Fig SpreadProsciutto with Figs & MascarponeWarm Artichoke SpreadRicotta with Dates & PistachiosRoasted Peppers with Goat CheeseSalami with PestoI'll spare you all super details. Just know that its all worthwhile. There were two in particular that the whole table loved. I'm not even sure \loved\ is a strong enough word. You absolutely must try \Brie & Apples with Fig Spread\ and \Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone.\ Freaking delicious!They are running a special now for an order of Bruschetta and a bottle of house wine for $20 mon-tue. This is one heck of a deal and a great way to get a little drunk and try the food on the cheap. Go and thank me later :)",ihB9dvN8,3159

I used to get acrylic nails and I would have them filled once every 3 weeks and I have never had a problem with lifting or breaking. I have also gotten the gel manicures and they have always lasted 2 weeks with no breakage or cracking. The pedicures have always been very relaxing and I have never felt like the tools were unclean or unsanitary. I have been getting my eyebrows waxed here and they have always turned out exactly how I have wanted. I have referred at least 3 of my coworkers to this nail salon and they are all still going years later. This salon is definately worth trying out.,avvKR8tG,2300

The prices would be the same if you went to Starbucks (which I wouldn't). They have cheesecake on a stick and my husband got his favorite pineapple shake. The whole front of the shop is a window and it's nice to sit and watch the cars go by. My husband and I took the light rail into Phoenix just to go here.

359,4.5,"I don't say this lightly at all, but honestly, this was the best steak I have ever had.  My husband agrees, and he's eaten a lot more meat in his life than me, so that says something.But, first things first. We arrived on a Sunday night with no reservation, but got in straight away.  I had some doubts about the place just on principal as usually hotel restaurants are overpriced and underwhelming.  But we were staying at the hotel and too tired and had seen some pretty good yelp reviews, so we figure, why not?The view was nice, augmented by a great firepit on the balcony.  The service was also excellent, everyone was friendly, helpful, and always there when you needed them, never there when you didn't.  Nothing snooty or condescending.  The crowd was mixed, which I'm assuming it usually is in Scottsdale.  Older retired types, daggy looking tourists from out-of-town, rich old guys with young girls with big fake breasts, people on business trips, etc.  I wouldn't call it trendy.For food we ordered a cold lobster appetiser with aioli, which was excellent. We both had filet mignons with about three sauces on the side, as recommended by our waiter.  The steak was amazing, thick and juicy and tender and full of flavor.  The sauces, as my husband pointed out, were really not necessary, but did kick it up to the next flavor level.  We had a side of asparagus to share.  We are not huge eaters, so sharing a starter, ordering a small size steak each, and one side dish was enough.  If you are a bigger eater you might want to order your own starter and one side dish per person, as the steaks come with no sides.  We ended up sharing the apple tarte dessert, which was good.  The apples were a bit too sweet, but the cinnamon ice cream on the side was just spicy enough to balance the overly sweet apples.Given the quality of the food I thought the prices were pretty fair. I\d go back if I lived in the area, of if I come visit again.  Thumbs up!",ctQIile8,4657

CDs are in multiple places and prices seem to differ from the last time you were there. The listening station is rarely crowded and staff  is usually quick to look something up for you.

WHAT COULD GO WRONG? ok ok ok so I went in pretty hung-over hoping to get a Mimosa to numb the pain a little but they don't have booze. We should have just left but the group figured that \ehhhhh we're here we might as well?\K so then we go to our table and the waitress takes FOREVER to come to our table and offer us water. Wait for water? Really? In Arizona? Does that seem right to you? Bring us water! Right away! Thirsty people are unhappy people.Anyways just to torture us our waitress is all over the table next to us and those customers even go \oh we get the BEST service here\ while we are sitting are there all unhappy without beverages and food. suckey.K so there's that u know which was not really cool. Then I mean the food comes. takes a while which isn't really shocking consider the lag to just get us water and coffee. I ordered 2 eggs scrambled with some feta cheese [my idea to add in cause I'm creative]  along with some nice thick bacon and some fruit and toast and shizzz. It was all ok, I mean I didnt order anything to crazy. There bacon was very tasty though.  All my friends that I went with got way more exotic breakfast stuff then me but I dunno it all looked a lot better then it tasted- which was a let down. Everything was just kinda blah. I mean my order was sorta blah, but the non-blah orders still tasted blah. BLAH!I just... yeah. I just really wasnt that impressed. I'm trying to think of something nice to say besides the bacon was good and the oj looked tasty. I got nothing, All in all Breakfast club was kinda expensive for what it was [mediocre food] and it was just, forgettable....",Bzfi6Odc,4912
367,4.8,"I LOVE Port of Subs.   I could eat here and never get sick of the food or the menu items. But, the service here on Sunday left me upset, sad and slightly irritated and annoyed! I've never been to this specific location, but on Sunday I wanted to take some friends on the light rail and then go here for lunch while the weather was still comfortable and nice.I know this place is near campus, and they probably get a lot of student riff raff, but I was a bit annoyed with the service that I recieved here.  Actually, I'm still bothered almost a day later.  I will attribute it to the fact that its students that were working here behind the counter.Anyways, for starters, I called here before hand to ask a few location questions.  These girls had NO idea where they were located.  Really, they didn't.  They couldn't tell me not only where they were close to, but had NO idea how far from the light rail they were.  I knew where she was better then she did!  I told her which one of the two stops would be closer for me to deboard at, and she had no clue.  I had to get out my light rail map at home to figure out where they were.  She was totally useless!  I only knew where to go because she told me she was near smashburger...and I figured out where to go from there.So friends and I take the light rail down to the College/Veterans Way exit.  We walk to the port of subs and I realize that I have to go to the bathroom.  I was mentioning it to my friends as we walked into the store, and out of no where, some girl at a table boasts out \WE DON'T HAVE PUBLIC BATHROOMS IF YOU NEED TO GO YOU NEED TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AT SUBWAY BUT YOU HAVE TO BUY SOMETHING.\  Um, I wasn't only NOT talking to her, but the fact that she took it upon herself to YELL it at me as I'm setting foot in the store is a whole different story.  I was SO annoyed!I mentioned to the service girl who was on break eating a sub that I wasn't addressing her about my bathroom concerns she responded with \Well, I couldn't help but hear you when you came in.\  REALLY?!?!?!   STFU please!  Your probably the same girl who answered the phone and doesn't know where your located at!Ugh, the food was good, but the two idiot ding dongs behind the counter need retraining and need to learn to not be beotches!!!",ViJwBqNR,4761

I'm pretty desperate for boba when i'm in Arizona since I don't have the luxury of having a boba place in every freakin corner like i do back home....... so i might will be back, but i'll make sure to make my order crystal clear to the kids who work here.So I went in a couple weeks ago, and this girl working the register is totally staring into space as i'm ordering. Now it's like a million degrees outside so I'm definitely craving something cool and refreshing, nothing milky. I tell this girl... \I want two jasmine green teas\. I made sure to make myself clear.... i did NOT say jasmine MILK tea, i said jasmine green tea since this has happened to me at this location before.When my drinks are done, the teenage boy yells \2 jasmine milk teas\. OMG. Did i not make myself clear??? SO i explain to this boy, i wanted jasmine green teas, i didn't order a milk tea. And he gives me the craziest look and says \ sooooooo you just want green tea?\ So i repeated myself and he says \ soooooo you don't want milk?\ YES CHILD, THAT'S WHAT I SAID! Do you not make that here? Omg I never had an issue ordering a jasmine green tea back home with workers who could barely speak english!!!

It means that I tend to get full off the complimentary bread before my meal even makes it to the table. There's just something about bread+butter.... mmm..ANYWAY, this is a nice \let's talk over lunch\ or \read my book over lunch\ kinda place. Definitely a bistro meets internet cafe tone.

I sat at the bar and the ambiance was outstanding a large open restaurant with a huge bar so you don't feel that cluttered or crowded while you enjoy your food. They had $2 drafts during happy hour which set my mood to Happy. I ordered a few small bites off there bar menu. Chicharones Tacos were very simple yet packed with flavor. I ordered a Chile Relleno and at first sight was disappointed that it wasn't deep fried until i took a bite. I have never been so overwhelmed by the flavors mingling in my mouth until now. A dried Chile stuffed with veggies and spices and boy it had some nice heat as well made me order a refreshing margarita only $5.

My biggest complaint is I don't like wasabi so what am I supposed to eat?  Yes I could get them without that sauce on them but then the roll is a bit dry wish I had another sauce option.  Also I'm not a fan of macadamia nuts either why put them on every roll???  It's just weird to me we are not in Hawaii and some people are allergic to nuts.  I did however find a roll I liked that was the Bay Island Roll which was a california roll topped w/ bay scallops,O9vK7tEX,2205

390,3.3,"Watery, watery salsa.  In fact, it's too watery to be considered a hot \sauce\ because even that has some measure of thickness to it.  It's odd that it is paired with chips, because the chips cannot hold any of it as it runs off immediately.  Such a bold name to have too - Habanero's.  So the food may be spicy, right?  No.  Even the \hot salsa\ which is allegedly made with Habanero is medium at best.  This isn't some macho claim that it's not hot enough for me personally; no, it's really not anything like a typical salsa with habanero ingredients.  When the food leans mild it's all to easy to label it as a gringo place, but even more so when it's under the pretense of being a place with some spicy Habanero ingredients.Service was incredibly slow, and it's another one of those places where it's ambiguous if you sit down for service, or order at the counter.  Food was above average, served hot, and in a reasonable portion size for the price.  That's the main positive for this place - that the food is good and worth tolerating the other issues.

The mixed drinks I found to be a little high priced. $8.50 for a shitty martini? I think not!They have a deal from 11am-3pm of .99 cents hamburgers, but apparently the catch is you have to buy a drink in order to get the burger deal. Without a drink the burgers are $4. I think that's a rip off. The burgers are decent, but not worth $4 or having to spend money on a drink just to get the burger for a buck.The jukebox is decent. A good mix of everything from Depeche Mode to Springsteen, lame top 40 and some pseudo country. I didn't dare play a DM song as this crowd looked like they would have lynched a Euro pop loving girl.They need to add more tables and chairs and dump some of the bar games.I'd give the place another shot as it's walking distance from my house, but you can get a better deal on drinks and food elsewhere.",auyTCtkG,3367

396,3.2,"What a perfect night!The whole family went to see \Anything Goes\, where my cousin Vincent Rodriguez III played one of the main roles.  So proud of him.  We took up eleven spaces with all the kiddies in tow.  It was a delight that they enjoyed the show, for it was old school with not much prop stimulation, just good old fashioned singing and tap dancing.Wright's last masterpiece is a gaudy one, at best...love him for that.  What the Shah of Iran lost, we received.  Yipee!  They must not drink as much in that part of the world, because Wright did not take into consideration how much Phoenicians use the potty, especially us women.   Then again, let's be Frank here, form follows function that has been misunderstood.  Only one stall on the main floor was bladder busting.  I had to run up several floors to find a shorter line.  Even in cocktail dress and high heels, I got up the ramp pretty quickly!  There are bars and snack concessions, if you need to wet your whistle and/or whet your appetite.Gammage has a very open layout with a wrap around stadium seating and an unobstructed view of the grand stage.  I didn't see much reminiscent of Wright's earlier works.  The superfluous \Baghdadish\ design exterior is not exactly a dead give away.  No stooping down entrances, then the \wow\ factor... not there.  There are the clean lines and the simplicity of the interior, which many of today's contemporary architects bestow, are so very Wright.Heed the parking warning.  Get there at least an hour before a show.  Wright's hatred of parking lots bastardizing his designs are clearly exhibited here.  The Gammage is one of the first building I fell in love with when I first moved to Phoenix.  I wonder what Frank's thoughts would have been if he had seen his last design come to fruition.  I'll take a past quote and plug it in for him:\Every great architect is - necessarily - a great poet. He must be a great original interpreter of his time, his day, his age.\  --Frank Lloyd Wright",cDkFyqkL,2479

I had the bone in ribeye which was cooked perfectly.  Great cut of meat.  Also had a tremendous bowl of delicious lobster mashed potatos.  Beware of all the butter though...there is plenty of it!Entertainment in the lounge area is great too.

My boys pick up on the name and start calling it by the South Park slang for \City Wok\ (it's crude, but funny).This place is no joke.  I drove over and ordered a selection of their fare and it was good, I mean real good for take-out.  It's not as pedestrian as, say, Pei Wei, but good.  My oldest took one bite out of his eggroll and before he could swallow it the youngest stole it from him and snarfed it down.  Both agreed that it was excellent even without sauce.  I had the General Tsu chicken, which was a huge portion, and wolfed it down without even pausing to belch.  Very good food, the decor is spartan and I have no idea about delivery.",reTieX4q,4049

404,3.4,This is not a buffet.I went in on a Tuesday 7 PM. The place was dead.I got the hot and sour soup which was pretty good.5.95. Pretty good portion. Split between 3 people.XO sauce spicy fried rice...NOT spicy at all. Very bland.Probably won't get that again.Assorted veggies plate with rice...it was okay.Wasn't the best I ever had but not bad either.Service was kind of slow,Vvb3gLKw,1696
405,4.4,I was standing on a corner in Scottsdale,4jq7dL70,2329
406,1.2,I finally tried Pho.  It has taken ages but a nice cold rainy sunday afternoon was enough to convince me that it was time to try this soup-like concoction.  I sure am glad that I did!  This stuff was great.  I ordered one that had meatballs in it.  The meatballs were a bit more like sausages but they were still tasty.  I'm probably not the person you want to listen to when it comes to Pho reviews since this was my first try but I really enjoyed it.  For anyone who has thought about it but never gone - this seems like as good a place as any to start.My only problem was with the service.  They were very disorganized and slow.  It was busy...but I'd still like to see a bit more hustle from the waiters.,ciD7wq0G,3606
407,3.3,"Holy cow... we had the worst experience here! The one up in Surprise was a million times better!First of all, we walked in with a party of four on a Friday night and they looked at us like we were crazy. The lovely gal up front asked if we had a reservation, and of course we did not. They weren't very busy at all for a Friday night, but she acted as if they were completely swamped. She informed us that it would be a 20 minute wait like it was the end of the world, but of course to us that seemed very reasonable. I guess we're just used to going to busier restaurants on the weekends?Anyway, the wait actually took over 45 minutes--definitely more than double her initial guess. Whatever, we were able to grab a few drinks before happy hour was over so we were happy. The bar was actually the busiest part of the restaurant, and their service was fast and friendly. However, the rest of the place definitely took away from our positive initial experience there.We were finally seated in the normal dining area and had the slowest, most forgetful waiter ever. I also noticed that the Hibachi area of the restaurant had barely anyone in it, so maybe that's why it took so long to get in. Everyone was trying to get into the smaller, normal restaurant section! :P We just wanted a nice regular meal with a regular waiter that night, but unfortunately our experience wasn't so great.We all asked for waters, and the waiter brought one. Gee, thanks. Communal water? LOL. He also kept forgetting things we'd ask for, so we actually had to ask other waiters/waitresses on THREE separate occasions for things that our waiter didn't bring. We would've reminded him, but he seemed to disappear for long periods of time after forgetting things. He also seemed to know whenever we were complaining about him, because he would show up immediately after. 6th sense for unhappy customers? :)Now, for the food... I had seafood kabobs, and they were okay. However, two of us had scallops in our meals and they were not cooked correctly. I know it's hard to cook them correctly, but these were just bad. The rest wasn't bad, but nothing great either... especially for the price.Oh, I think the biggest part that bothered me was the location of the restrooms. It was right next to the kitchen, so it was constantly busy with waiter traffic. This is fine, but the attitude of said traffic was what bothered me. The first time, three waiters almost ran into me on my trip to the restroom. They just looked at me as if I was in the wrong place, and of course I said \excuse me.\ They didn't say anything... just looked at me and went around. On my second trip to the restroom, three waiters/waitresses were standing in the hallway just talking to one another, blocking the entire walkway. I walked up and stood there, finally saying \Excuse me, I have to get to the restroom.\ One girl moved to the side a little bit, but the guy standing in the middle had his arms crossed with his elbows sticking way out and didn't even acknowledge me. I had to maneuver around his impertinent elbows in order to fit through the tiny gap the one kind waitress had made for me. Basically, I was thinking \WTF?!\When we were done eating, after we had paid the bill, we then realized that we had been there for over 3.5 hours. Ridiculous! The service was extremely slow and mostly unfriendly, the food wasn't good for the price we paid, and we just ended up being pissed off in general after leaving. This was our first trip to this Hayashi, but we wanted to try it out after having so many fantastic experience up at the Surprise location. I guess the name is the only thing these 2 locations have in common.",n7flhFQY,819

409,2.1,"Wal-Mart, particularly this one, pleases me since it's open 24 hours. That is where the pleasantries end. Everything else about Wal-Mart makes me want to vomit. Let me give you some tips for your next visit to the Riverview Wal-Mart:-Use the santizer wipes when you get your shopping cart, the carts seem so dirty I don't think they have been cleaned since 'nam. -Make sure you allot at least 15 minutes for check out. The lines are slow moving and may I suggest you buy a deck of cards to play a few games of solitaire while waiting in line.-Keep your eyes open! You will most likely spot some of the weirdest people you have ever seen. I despise Wal-Marts; this one is no different. That isn't a preconceived hatred...it is a loathsome feeling that has been nurtured through many Wal-Mart shopping trips filled with bad service, weird people, and crappy products. Not all of their stuff is bad, but most of the things that they sell so \cheap\ are exactly that, cheap. So pardon me while I roll back my eyes as they roll back their prices. Even if the whole store had a 99% off sale I doubt I would subject myself to the madness that is a crowded Wal-Mart. Someday maybe Wal-Mart will fly me out to Arkansas where they make themselves home and prove how my ideas are mere misconceptions. Til then, Target...always and forever.",JOEdzuvl,4802

It was inexpensive at only $2.99 and simple yet tasty.  It was a roll that was brushed with butter and grilled then topped with fresh tomatoe,PABuGGUk,161
416,4.4,I work right across the street from the Restaurant and really have been craving modern Mexican food lately.  I decided today to head over there on my dinner break and ate by myself and had the best experience.  I was automatically offered a drink by someone who wasn't my server.  I ordered my food and it was promptly served.  My server refilled my drink before i was emptly.  I was asked my four different employees how everything was going!  My plates were cleared immediately by another server and a box was brought out by someone else and the bill as well.  They have this great group of people that help each other out in getting things taken care of.   The food was really great.  I ordered Pozole soup and the corn tamale.  I also got to try the mushroom tacos because there were extras.  Anyway i would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone.  This is definitely what Mill needed as far as a nice bar with some food options.  I'll be frequenting this place quite often.,s9b3gogK,1244

427,3,I have a 2002 Volvo S60 that had an oil leak. I brought it in to have them diagnose the issue and they looked over the entire car from top to bottom with the most accurate and honest assessment of the car. The staff there is very friendly and understanding of your situation. The price to get the assessment was very fair. He explained all of the issues in full detail with a most to least urgent list. He also mentioned the mechanics of each piece what the fault of one item does to the rest of the system.There are a lot of auto shops out there and it's hard to pick one that you think will be honest and fair. I will undoubtedly go here any time my Volvo needs work.,nIH4zfkR,464
428,1.9,We frequent this place and I just have to comment on the service by the manager the last time that I was in. I ordered the White Sands Chimichanga (usually scrumptious) and it wasn't anywhere near the exception that it usually is. For some reason the meat was not that good. We mentioned it to the manager and she was quick to take it off the bill. We weren't expecting that or inquiring for that reason,61Mcqv3m,647
429,5,"This place is tucked away in my old stomping grounds. As a former \Rocket\ I had to see what they hype was about. Took a drive into my ol' hood. And was shocked how the neighborhood had changed so much in 30 years! Rocket Burger is tucked behind Church's Chicken. It did not disappoint! I have been there twice now. I have tried the rueben sandwhich, California club, California burger, the NYer fries and onion rings. All of it was great and affordable. The subs are packed with meat and the sandwiches are big enough for two people to split. My least favorite was the burger. But for subs I would go back. The onion rings were crunchy, with a light coat of batter, and thinner which I like. The fries were just ok. But then, fries are not my thing. My kids liked that they could pick out any type of soda. I picked one that tasted like a mojito. My daughter had a pear soda, and my youngest had a delicious rootbeer that had butterscotch in it. The coleslaw on the NYer was great! It was fresh and crunchy! In fact all the vegetables were fresh! Even the avocado, it wasnt just a little bit that came on the burger, but it was enough to cover the entire bottom bun. The tomato was wasnt chintzy either, Yay! Great family business that I would support any day over the big guys. This place rocks. And all of us can find something to eat here. Score!",davqSTL6,2364

I support Jiffy Lube like you would not believe but I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO NOT GO HERE (NOT THIS JIFFY LUBE)!!!They purposely damaged my tire to spite me!!!Yesterday morning, when I got an oil change, I was encouraged to upgrade to a higher quality oil - I declined.  When I was encouraged to change my air filer - I declined.  When I was encouraged to change my cabin air filer - I also declined.  It came to a point of forced upgrades where I literally said, \I just want an oil change and I have to go.\This morning I noticed my front tire was WAY low of air (they checked it yesterday).  I filled it asap but noticed air seeping uncontrollably through the valve.  I took to to a Goodyear (on Indian School) and they said, \The only way this can happen is if someone loosens it.  There is no way it can come unloose by itself. The pressure is too high.\  They even asked if I, \...had any enemies.\  When I told them, o, but I did get an oil change yesterday at the Jiffy Lube on 32nd they replied, \This isn't the first time dude.  About once every few months someone comes in with this issue from that Jiffy Lube.\Enough said.I know corporate people at Shell Oil and jiffy Lube.  They are great people and they have supported my business.  I will always support Jiffy Lube but never (again) this franchise or their staff.

I had the yellowtail and the spices and sauce complimented each bite in a different way. My friend's snapper with basamati was amazing with the berries in the rice adding a great flavor. Husband got steak which is grass fed and free range, and it melted in your mouth! We had our 14 year old with us who wanted a burger and the server accommodated by allowing her to order something that was normally only available on the bar menu.Save room for dessert. We had the Strawberry \cheesecake\ which was the best and the others got the beignets  with creme brulee..PERFECTION.The ONLY slight knock is that the music was WAY too loud for a place that charges what they do for food.

438,3.7,"How can I tell I am enjoying myself? When an avid carnivore such as myself comes out happy after  picking on the  beans and vegetables on this planet. The portions , for such a thin clientele, are large.  Someone mentioned the attractiveness of the staff and that would be a fair statement. ( Then again anyone with purple anything and Flogging Molly shirt had me at hello to begin with:)  Quick service, drinks filled quickly.   I had the black bean burger   with roasted red bell pepper, mixed greens, tomatoes, cucumbers and onions on a 12-grain bread, served with blue corn chips, pico de gallo and garlic new potatoes.    Really good bread, didn't get soggy or fall to bits prior to finishing it off and the price was  close to  what you end up paying subway for their \ high end\ sandwiches The appetizer  isn't really rated since  dolmas  have such a wide range of  ingredients , like pakora,  you often don't know what you're going to get. It's not that these are bad, they just have  a consistency that's  too close to a couple of foods I really hate.   The tsatziki and pita though I can happily recommend  as being really good for the former and good enough on the latter. Decor,  great apart from the ceiling which would appear to be the surplus left over from the diners.  It's just odd to have such a well put together floor and sides , add in a great big mirror above a waiting area with fireplace and then reflect this gaudy embossed carbunkle back at us as if we hadn't had enough:).

In any case, with the exception of the lamb burger, I have been thoroughly pleased with everything I've tried. Their bar is well stocked, and service is great - somewhat casual but appropriate, attentive, and not overbearing.

The term makes the event feel extremely exaggerated on paper as it only consists of a few tables under a tent with loaves of breads, jams, salad dressings, greens, and knickknacks.

469,3,"Dude, where's my lazy river time?This year for my birthday my girlfriend did the really sweet thing of getting us a room at the Villas because she knows that I love steaks AND lazy rivers. This place, by its proximity to the bigger Marriott next door, had both. It was such a good plan, until the policies and management of the Canyon Villas made it all go wrong.We live in Phoenix. We wanted to do a stay-cation. I love lazy rivers. Its like river tubing but with a bar always near by, so I can be even lazier and not have to be responsible for a cooler or its contents. Our plan was to check in early (as we requested an early check in) and then go float the lazy river until I was either sun burned or drunk or both.This, due to some very shifty moves on the part of Canyon Villas, did not happen either on Sunday or Monday.We get there at 2, which is not even \early check-in\ by most standards, ready with our bags in hand and visions of chlorine treated pool water rotating in a predestined circle in our heads.And they then explained \oh, we're not going to be able to do that. Come back after 4\Mind you, the other two people standing there, got checked right in. Guess they must have been \owners\ huh Marriott?Four? Four PM? Are you kidding? Is this a poor taste birthday joke?Nope.We, highly discouraged, head over to the concierge's stand to make reservations at the Meritage. During this she tried to hustle us into a 90 minute presentation on the virtues of \vacation club ownership.\ So let me get this straight, I don't get to get into the pool before dinner, but yet you want ME to give YOU, the MARRIOTT, 90 minutes of my time?So that didn't happen.We finally get into our room closer to 5pm because the desk staff wasn't ready for the bums rush of people checking in. Dinner was at 8, we were exhausted, tired of the crap coming out of the mouths of the employes of this place, so we took a nap.At 6 I called down, asking for a late check out as the normal check out is 10:00 IN THE MORNING...Best they could do was 11. And our pool passes expired on check out.Long story short, don't stay here if you're just coming in for a night. Its a rip-off, nothing more than a way to get you in as a captive audience for a sales pitch to join a pyramid scheme. I never did get to go in the lazy river. But I did get to deal with lazy staff and managers who were rude and ineffective. When we mentioned on check-out that we were highly unhappy with our stay there, the desk staff didn't bat an eye or make any effort to make things right. This is the mark of a totally unprofessional operation. Worst of all, my girlfriend was really sad because of how hard she tried to do something nice for me on my birthday. That sucks. I guess this is how they try to get you to buy into their vacation club?",ZSr5N0bA,2321

The bad:  We were there for and hour and a half and we had only ordered an appetizer and a dish to split.  They weren't super busy so I don't understand why the food took sooo long.  The trout spread that we got took a good 15 minutes to get to us and the main dish took another 15 minutes after we had finished with the app.  The layout was also a bit weird.  It took us a few tries to figure out where the hostess stand was.  If you come in the front entrance, you have to walk through through the dining room to get there. Also some of the pricing is outrageous for what you get.  I understand that local means that the meal will be more expensive, and I'm all for helping out the little guy. But come on!  I order a \lemon-lime soda\ (as it says on the menu) for $2.50 and the waitress hands me a can of Sprite!  Ridiculous!

My daughter enjoyed a mango smoothie and 2 bean & cheese tostadas. There were maybe 6 other people in the restaurant at the time. Their were three waitress's in the restaurant averaging in age from 18 to 20 or so it appeared. I  Had to asked three times for water and had to go tell waitress we wanted our check. The waitress was pleasant but had to ask her what she said several times because she spoke so softly. The decor was very lack luster and the large photo's of food behind the cash register in addition to the sign that said order above register would lead one to think maybe you order at window ( had I not read the reviews of others to learn otherwise ),9VdYE4GJ,2962
485,5,A coworker who goes to Phoenix often recommend this place especially since I love to shop. This is for serious shoppers who are patient and willing to search high and low for a particular size and style. This is a Nordstrom clearance store that includes returned and overstocked items. The experience is like going to a Nordstrom Rack and a thrift store. Although it can be a little cluttered in some areas,IopwscLF,1495
486,2.1,"It's hard to talk me into eating at Garcia's since they are like the Chili's of \Mexican\ food. But, there aren't many options left at AZ Mills so it was what we decided to have for lunch. Somehow I could have eaten the chips and spicy bean dip and been happy with that. But I ordered the most American-Mexican dish you can order, Pollo Fundido. I wasn't in the mood to think or look through the menu and knew the cooks are probably used to making it for everyone so it would be a safe choice. It was, and the rice and beans on the side were better than average. The only thing I forgot was to say no slice of melted orange American cheese, yuck. But it was easy to push off, and the shredded chicken inside was hot and fresh so I couldn't complain. I really didn't like how small their plastic cups were, our waitress was slow and my iced tea was empty a few times. Also I asked her for more of that spicy bean dip and she never brought any even though she said she would. I saw several other waiters bringing out refills of it to other tables and I thought they might be coming to ours at one point but no. Could I have asked again? Yes. Did I care enough to? No. Was I full and ready to walk off my meal in the mall? Yeah, so I guess it wasn't that bad of a lunch.",Vn1mvyqI,1387

But truly, I have...I have had better.PHX Mag said to try the crab cakes, which we did, and they were delicious.  Very happy with them and therefore expected the entrees to be just as great...but they weren't.  : (  I had the salmon, which the waitress recommended and it was such a bummer.  It had way too many conflicting tastes going on that didn't seem to blend at all.  I lost my appetite after a few bites.  My boyfriend had the shrimp tacos which were just...average.  We were really disappointed.  Again, the crab cake appetizer was great and the two margaritas were as well - the Tontorita and the Prickly Pear - both very, very yummy.

I took a look at the menu as I walked in and was intrigued. I must admit that I am a bit of a traditionalist when it comes to dining. Not feeling like branching out too much I picked the BLT.

It's possibly worse to look at than Johnny Rockets or 5 & Diner. There are also far too customization options available, which panics the anxious toppings-whore deep within me, but may prove to excite the intrepid, messy eaters of the world. Despite the unusual amount of decision-making required to eat here, and the pride-swallowing attached to having to actually call something a \cheeburger,\ it's not a bad place to go when you're really hungry and possess the ability to tune out your surroundings. My friend polished off the Famous Pounder here not once, but twice, which could translate to a rewarding experience for budding power-eaters. Unfortunately, if you're going there expecting to carve your niche as the next Joey Chestnut, you'll be disappointed to see how much ASU dude-bros can consume when drunk.

We are having sooo much fun trying independent places instead of big chains; we are discovering a new world of great places right here within a few miles of us...Based on what others say, I think we made a good decision in going when Teharu is busy, a Friday night. 2 of us waited about 15-20 mins for seats, which was fine. Because they were so busy, all of the sushi we had off the belt was fresh & delicious, lots of variety. It's not super high-end gourmet sushi, but we didn't expect that from a volume revolving place. A nearby diner ordered special custom items & said he's happy every time & that the staff is wonderful about special requests. He also says the variety is constant, regardless of traffic flow.We tried a bunch of different things. We like the belt, as we branch out from menus; \What the heck? It's $1.50/$2, let's try one!\ Although of course personal preference plays into it, all were really good in flavor & quality.

The senior did not want to send it back because she just isn't that way. The Childs needed to go back. It was dry and tough and horribly over flavored with Morrells. By the time her replacement dish came we were all done and ready for dessert. Waitress just said \I'll just wrap it up\. What like she shouldn't eat?!!?Anyway long story short is it was horrible service and they did not even offer to remove one of the awful meals. Very disappointed in Capital Grille. This location anyway. The one in Ft Lauderdale was always great.

It was mostly onion, which is a pretty big cop-op for an overpriced omelet.

The decor was cute - it's always entertaining to eat somewhere that feels \trendy\.

538,1.4,"After hearing about it for a while, we were very excited to try this theater for their food, drinks and movie. We made reservations online and got perfect seats which is a big plus. Front row=I don't go. It's awesome to be able to sit down and order food when you're cutting it close on time for a movie. I was a little disappointed by the menu - it reminded me of a bar menu and nothing really jumped out at me. The waitress took my order before the previews - a chicken wrap and popcorn. The chicken wrap came about 15 minutes later and was decent. The popcorn took 45 MINUTES. When we inquired about the popcorn, we were scolded with \it's not my department\ from the waitress. By the time it came we were over it, so the $7/free refill deal is a joke considering the service is so slow. Garage parking is free with validation.I would go again just because the seating is so comfortable, but I would rather eat before!",bBE8Bx93,2746
539,1.3,I may or may not give these guys a second chance. No draft beer was available when I was there because their draft system was broken.  The selection of draft beers looked o.k. nothing outstanding but their bottle selection sucked. If a place is calling itself a brewery at least try and have some real beer. The worst part though was the food... $6 for a fried bologna sandwich? Are you kidding me? Cute names on the food but poor execution.,Xelvm1qG,4035

I had the carne asada burrito, which was quite large and very good. Everything tasted fresh and it wasn't very \heavy\ for a carne asada burrito. My friend had the breakfast burrito and he loved it.

In order to get people to stay and drink beer, they have to have a good menu . . . check!  To get said people to come back again and again you have to have good tasting food, right?  CHECK, CHECK, and DOUBLE CHECK!!All of the food I've had is top notch and delicious!  And the beers??  I crave them!!  It was Kilt Lifter that first hooked me.  Then the Hop Knot (see my Nello's review for the best Hop Knot in town tip).  And the Pumpkin Porter, one of the best seasonals EVER!  While I think it is spectacular that you can get various Four Peaks Brew's at some of the coolest establishments across the state (even the Pumpkin Porter, when available), there is one brew that I can only find when I am lucky enough to go to Four Peaks . . . THE OATMEAL STOUT.  This is the most delicious, most creamy and smooth beer I have ever had in my life.  I dream of this beer.  The first time I tried this was shortly after I started drinking (and liking) stouts.   I tasted it, looked over at my BF and said \I think this is better than Guinness.\  Of course I got the evil eye, but I'm sticking to my guns.  The Oatmeal Stout at Four Peaks is my favorite beer of all time!Favorites from the menu include, Spicy Thai Hummus, Spanakopita, Bavarian Pretzels, Shrimp & Goat Cheese Bruschetta (it's a meal, but the garlic is no joke on this one), the salads are great, Bleu Light Special Burger, Veggie Beer Bread Wrap, Fish and Chips . . . just to name a few! =)The patio is great.  The staff is friendly.  The parking is not the best, but eh, everything else makes it worth it.  Plus, I suggest taking a cab or the light rail anyway . . . better to not have to drive so that you can enjoy more brews!",0wy3rUrR,2431
545,1.3,Sweetie and I have passed by several times and have always wanted to stop in. It's really an appealing place from inside and out.  We really wanted to love it but sadly we couldn't. The room itself is fabulous but the food and service just don't hold up. First it took forever to get attention and drinks. My general rule is to walk out if I'm ignored for 5 minutes and we went well past that ...sweetie was hungry and didn't want to hunt another spot down on a Saturday night and intervened. The waiter seemed more interested in telling us about Eddie on the Food Network than he is in getting our order and was AWOL most of the evening. ...Drinks took about 15 minutes to arrive ....Eddie is more interested in being a celebrity than he is in making sure food gets out....and is properly seasoned. Appetizers took 30 minutes and the manager astutely comped them after we pointed out that we'd been waiting for 25 minutes for food. They would have gone back had they not been free as the grilled calamari was inedibly salty. I mean I like salt and this was headache salty. I had Chilean Sea Bass which was absolutely perfectly cooked but the menu said it was to be served with lemon candied broccolini and instead it was served with lemon zested broccoli. (Yes Eddie there is a difference) Sweetie's salmon was also perfectly cooked but the cloyingly sweet baclava it was served over was kind of off putting and really didn't match up. It also had some odd spice combinations that just didn't work. We skipped desert. There are too many better options in downtown Scottsdale so I don't think we'll be back.,sdXx1iC0,2489
546,4.8,"The GF and I have heard so many good things about Binkley's over the years from people that we know that have dined there and from reading reviews online. We finally decided that we had to try it to see how it stacked up against Kai, which is our favorite restaurant in the PHX area. I made reservations for Friday night of Memorial Day weekend a little over a week in advance. Since Binkley's is about 35 miles from the neighborhood that we both live in, we decided to make a weekend of it and stay at The Boulders. The week leading up to the meal, we were both so excited that we both joked that we were getting very little work done due to the anticipation of the amazing meal we were going to have on Friday night.Friday finally came and we arrived right on time for our 7p reservation. We were promptly greeted by the hostess and promptly seated at the absolute worst table in the house. It was in the bar area, right next to the front door. The most insulting part of it was the hostess tried to tell us what an amazing table it was because the vases of flowers that separated our table from the front door were so pretty. In the grand scheme of things, not a big deal if you wow us with the food. After all, we knew from many reviews that atmosphere is not the strong selling point of the restaurant.After we were seated, we waited for a good 15 minutes before being greeted by a server. This is one of my pet peeves in a fine dining establishment. I like to be greeted promptly by the server and offered a cocktail so I can enjoy a drink while reviewing the menu. Once we were finally greeted we ordered cocktails and enjoyed them when they were finally served. Being that this was our first Binkley's experience, we both decided that we would go \whole hog\ and order the 6 course tasting menu with the $50/ea wine pairing. As has been mentioned in may other reviews online, a meal at Binkley's consists of a long parade of amuses. Sadly, in a meal of more misses than hits, the amuses provided more of the hits.The big hit of the night was the summer truffle grits that the GF ordered as her hot appetizer. Both of us agreed that these were amazing. Unfortunately, most everything else was relatively forgettable (her halibut fish course was absolutely boring). My quail meat course was quite good, but not something that I would drive 35 miles to experience again.Throughout the night, the service and the pacing was uneven. Sometimes there was a very lengthy time between courses while other courses were brought to quickly. While our main server was perfectly friendly, she lacked fine dining polish and disappeared for long periods of time (especially when it was time for the check!) several times over the course of the evening.As for the wine pairings, those were also hits and misses. The pourings themselves were quite anemic and with long times between courses, there were several times that I had finished my pour before the course even arrived. For a total of $100 between the two of us, I felt the wine was a weak spot in the evening.The most entertaining part of the meal was the Gordon Ramsay-esque, f-bomb laced tirade that Chef Binkley went on at some point during the meal. Apparently his kitchen staff wasn't doing things his way and he was letting them know. Quite comical, although a little uncomfortable to other diners around as we could clearly hear every word that he screamed at his staff.When all was said and done, we spent a little over $400 with tip for dinner. While it certainly wasn't the worst meal of either of our lives, we both agreed that it didn't even come near cracking the top 20. We were both glad that we dined at Binkley's to have the firsthand experience, but we both left feeling that it was overrated. Perhaps they were having an off night, maybe it has slipped over the years, or maybe it's just a victim of being over-hyped. Whatever the case, I don't think we will be dining at Binkley's in the future.",xaRkSpMk,4450

555,1.1,"Terrible customer service!      I went into their office having read a good review on here. I started the application process, then I cam home and discovered the multitude of terrible reviews on this site http://www.apartmentratings.com/rate/AZ-Tempe-Willow-Creek.html and I was horrified. Besides terrible reviews, one of the reviews from just last year mentioned bed bugs. This is information I could not live with and sleep soundly.   I sent the leasing agent and email the same night and asked that he cancel my application.      The next day I got and email refuting the bed bugs and a call from the leasing agent. That was polite and all, but they tried to say those people brought the bugs with them. If you know anything about bed bugs they can live in a building for up to 1 year without feeding, and are next to impossible to get rid of in an apartment complex unless everyone in the complex gets rid of all of their belongings and/or treats each item properly (heat or chemically). Its a huge ordeal! So, I was not amused.     2 days later I get a call from another person in the office trying to win me back. Well, she did the most terrible job! When I told her that there was no way I would reconsider, she insisted that I still owed them $122 for administrative fees (it's $44 for the application and 75 for \move in fees\). I'm not moving in there, why on earth should I pay a move in fee? When I refused this outlandish demand, she then tried to guilt me into bringing a new check for the application fee of $44. I said that I'd be happy to if they sent me an email confirming my cancellation and would provide me with my credit report. I have not yet received an email. This woman was very rude, and a bully. I can only imagine how terrible it would have been to have to deal with her as a resident. I am certainly not moving into Willow Creek and I would suggest you save your time and energy as well. Willow creek obviously does not want to spare their already tainted reputation.",KD0DmjNa,576

The matzo ball soup was also tasty, with the flavor of homemade broth.It had been quite a while since my last visit to Miracle Mile Delicatessen and the new decor gives it a lighter, airier feel than I remembered.

563,4,My husband and I went to the fair on Saturday 11/6 and had a nice evening.  We parked for free at the State Capitol and took the free shuttle to the fair grounds and got there at about 5pm at which point admission was BOGO so we both entered for $10.  We did a little walking around and decided to have dinner.  I had a teriyaki chicken bowl - not so great - and he had a BBQ sandwich with coleslaw which was pretty good.  The food was fairly pricey but I guess that is to be expected.  We then went to the Megadeth concert in the Coliseum for free and had pretty good seats.  With the exception of smelling some marijuana and bad breath occasionally the concert was fun.  After the concert we walked around a little more and then decided to take trip on the Sky Ride which was nice.  We then decided to try some of the fried foods - smart or not - my husband tried the deep fried butter (cinnamon) and I tried the deep fried cheesecake.  I didn't try the butter myself but I can say the cheesecake would be much better without having been fried.  All in all we had a fun evening without spending much for admission and spending nothing for the concert.  We didn't feel unsafe at all and everywhere we looked there were police.  I would definitely feel safe going to the fair again but I will keep in mind the warnings about the opening day deals and the tendancy of gangs to show up heavily on that day.,ME2K6plC,4407

566,3.1,"This was my second time playing Dinosaur, the first being for $40 bucks the day before they closed for overseeding so I decided to check it out when the conditions were optimal. I had forgotten how tacky the practice facility was (as it's described in previous reviews). The course was in good condition and they actually let the rough grow out long unlike a lot of resort courses.  Some complaints besides the practice area?The GPS wouldn't update half the time for the distances whenever my cart would move. Starting on the 4th hole and every hole until I made the turn, the restaurant ad came up to order food. And on every hole, it gave me the same two reminders to not drive in the desert and to also repair ball marks. I spent more time clicking \ok\ on the GPS than anything else. Also, pretty ghetto in the sense that there is no drinking water available on the course anywhere except through the cart chick. Bottom line-There are plenty of courses much closer for a lot better value. We Ko Pa is much better (and cheaper as AZ resident) and if you still feel the need to drive 45 minutes, check out Quintero Country Club north of Peoria. Just as beautiful of scenery and lots of elevated tee boxes, equal conditions, cheaper price, and actually have complimentary water bottles in refrigerators every other hole.",eStL3S4v,862

They are a gift from on high, and the black eyed peas are insanely good.  Redolent with pork and seasoning, they trump any black eyed pea you have ever had.  Cornbread is grilled and isn't the dry, crumbly, cakey crap some places have the gall to give you, and the macaroni and cheese is soupy, cheesy and perfectly cooked, just like you wanted.I saw plates literally overflowing with smothered pork chops and chicken, and if I hadn't been full to the point of a coma after eating all the chicken and greens and mac and cheese I could hold, I would have ordered some.  Or catfish.  Or neck bones.  Desserts offered by one of the ladies who cooks walking through the dining room going \Who's gonna have peach cobbler?\.  Who??? ME!  That's who!

This charming Italian restaurant, owned by a privately held larger company, feels like a locally owned restaurant. The restaurant is warm and inviting and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. We were immediately greeted by Lori, the catering manager who was kind and engaging. We met our server, the tall and statuesque Dora, and the meal began.She knows the menu completely and had recommendations.  The price points were reasonable- one diner nearby said, \FINALLY, we have a GO TO restaurant here with the right price point that isn't based around a bar.\ This is a charming restaurant and the food was exceptional. I am Italian and never would have guessed this is a chain. Beginning with the wine, the price points were reasonable. I would suggest a \house wine\ carafe price for a red and a white and watch them sell like crazy. Wine snobs won't buy them, but regular people will......Next came the delectable bread with the house-made extra virgin olive oil infused with fresh herbs. DIVINE. Dora warned us it was addictive and she was right.Big Daddy ordered the spaghetti bolognese as he is a self-professed conneisseur and he loved it. It was rustic, with three different meats; fresh tomatoes; carrots; onions; and other sumptious items cooked for 8 hours. We are really picky about bolognese and I intend to order it next week. AWESOME. He asked for linguine and it was given! They have a whole wheat option (Big Daddy is big on fiber :)) and they only had a penne. Good choice, but they should consider a whole wheat spaghetti or linguine for people who want it.Our Maximillian (14) loved the spaghetti with tomato sauce. I tasted it with a cook's palette and it was light, perfectly seasoned and good. I would order it myself for sure.I had the Spinach ravioli. The ravioli was clearly house-made and the spinach stuffing was delicious. The tomato cream sauce and fresh spinach on top were great, only needing a few red pepper flakes (which I received upon request) to balance the dish out. Dessert was tiramusu and flourless chocolate cake with chocolate peppermint ice cream. They were both delicious but the tiramusu won the day.Finally, we met Jeff Cohen, Director of Operations for the West Coast for this organization. A lofty title that we are sure is well deserved. Most importantly, to us, he seemed like the sole proprietor of a local joint. That was the best. We came to find out that his daughter, goes to our son's school. A small world. He clearly takes personal pride in opening these restaurants. We would sure like to see more of him.Thank you for a great new restaurant in our neighborhood!Laurie, Rodney and Maximillian Malone",X2CHeUAz,457

I can finally join the ranks of the other (almost) 400 Yelpers to post a review!After hearing SO much about it and working downtown for 10 years, it sure has taken me a long time to get there!  Even the deserted patio (at 5:30 on a Thursday in August) made me happy.  Walking inside, instantly greeted by a friendly host, followed by an equally friendly server.  Service was stellar, attentive, kind, informed, relaxed but not lazy, and suggesting menu items which I always appreciate.We decided on the special pizza of the night.  Pizza Marechiaro : Fresh Bufala Mozzarella, San Marzano Dop, Chopped basil and Sea salt!  Like a \super-margherita\ the server said.  How could we NOT get it?  We also go the Pesto Salad which came with roasted potatoes, a light pesto dressing, and delicious bread to go with.The salad was delicious as was the pizza!  The ingredients were super fresh, the crust was the perfect amount of chewy, the prices were reasonable, and YES there was not a two hour wait to go with the food (even though, I still love the other place too!).  The only part that I didn't love was that the super fresh tomato-ey sauce made the crust a little droopy when I picked it up.  My favorite is a crispy crust that doesn't fall when you take a bite, but hey, small price to pay for perfection every where else.Even the tiny little flowers in the tiny little bud vase on the table made my day!  I can't wait to go back again . . . and again . . . and again.  Lucky me I work about a mile away!

I cut it in half to enjoy the salsas separately.  Filled to the brim with rice, cheese, beans and the fish and smothered in some sort of sauce, it was delicious!  Service was super-friendly and everyone had a smile on their face and said \Amy, your fish burrito is ready!\  I mean, the personalized service was great.

589,5,"My friend had recommended Spinato's Pizza so I decided to try it out with her since I had never been and she had liked it. Spinato's is a locally owned family pizzeria that started in Phoenix in 1974. They now have 5 locations spread throughout the valley. Since I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants, I was more than excited to try this new pizzeria especially since it was Chicago style pizza. The best pizza I ever had was in fact in Chicago.We arrived around 5:30 on Friday evening and the place was starting to getting crowded. The hostess seated us in the bar area since it seemed like a more ideal place to sit versus the dining room. She dropped off the menus and advised that our server would be with us momentarily. We waited about 15 minutes or so before our server acknowledged that we were in her section. She got our drink and food orders since we had more than enough time to make up our minds.My friend opted to get the Going Greek salad (side $3.99) and the Tomato Basil Bruschetta ($7.29). I decided on the personal 7\ sized Baked Spaghetti Calzone w/meatballs ($5.49). I decided to not drink as I had to drive and I wanted to get dessert.She got her salad and the bruschetta which she shared with me. When I think of bruschetta, I imagine it on a sturdy crispy piece of french bread or baguette  not on a piece of focaccia. Now don't get me wrong - I love focaccia as much as the next person, but focaccia isn't a sturdy piece of bread to pile on tomatoes drenched in olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The bruschetta was good but did not blow me away by any means. It had good flavor but it's not something that sticks out in my mind.Half way through the bruschetta, our server brought the baked spagetti calzone which was enormous and I got the smallest size! I can only imagine what the other sizes look like (out of control). It smelled delicious and had marinara sauce spilling over the top of it. I took my first bite and was absolutely horrified by what I tasted. The sauce was sweet?! Who on earth makes sweet marinara sauce? That should be a crime! It didn't even have the slight essence of Italian herbs that are a requirement in all marinara sauces and the sweetness was overbearing. I had to doctor it up by piling on the parmeasan and the red pepper flakes before I deemed it edible. I was able to eat half of it before I decided it was time for dessert.The dessert was Spinato's only saving grace from getting one star from me. I'm partially lactose intolerant and can't eat ice cream, ranch or sour cream (I know my life sucks!) they had gelato which I can eat! My friend got two scoops of vanilla bean and chocolate and I decided to get pistachio, raspberry sorbet, and vanilla bean. The gelato was decadently smooth and creamy. I wasn't thrilled about the pistachio as I could sense the almond extract in it and I'm not a fan! The raspberry and vanilla bean made up for it. The raspberry sorbet was tart and sweet and mixed with the vanilla bean balanced each other out.We had to be wheeled out because we were so full...it was official - I had a spaghetti calazone baby! Overall, I was not impressed with Spinato's and there are better pizzerias in Phoenix that one can go to. I like that it's locally owned, a family owned business, and their gelato.",kj6mpdYQ,4081

591,1.9,"The phrase \Guy ate here\ seems to be popping up quite a bit around the Valley.On the hunt for some great Italian food, it's no surprise that Guy Fieri, of the Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, found La Piazza Al Forno, one of downtown Glendale's independent eateries.If you've never been to downtown Glendale, it has a certain untouched-by-progress charm that's worth seeking out. There are antique and gift shops, historic homes and a choice of interesting places to eat.Owned by chef Justin Piazza, La Piazza is all about comfort Italian. The menu might be small but it packs a wallop, offering a range of pizzas, pasta and a handful of salads. I went hog wild because there were so many things that I wanted to try, and at their low prices I indulged.Might as well start with something light, like the Spinach Salad ($8), which is covered in a warm bacon vinaigrette and topped with feta cheese. The spinach was super fresh, showing the commitment to the best and newly picked ingredients. Considering the meager cost of this huge salad shared by two hefty eaters there is some serious value to be had here.Antipasti offerings are kept simple, with only a handful of choices, but one caught my eye. I was elated with each bite of Fried Ravioli ($8.50). Breaking through the crispy pasta revealed an inside filled with a molten cheesy heaven. This come with a side of tomato sauce for dipping and once you get started with these bad boys, it's hard to stop.Based on the name alone, anything called Spaghetti Pie ($9) is worth ordering. So I was tickled when the massive slab of baked spaghetti resembling a brick was set onto the table. Spaghetti was layered with cheese and finished with a tomato sauce cream sauce that was so satisfying. The spaghetti pie was a daily special, but from other visits it's pretty normal to see it featured.Their pizzas are baked in a wood-burning oven. Preparation takes only a few minutes and the intense heat slightly chars and crisps the pizzas. The Italian Stallion ($16), in all of its meaty goodness, is covered with fresh mozzarella, pepperoni, sausage, prosciutto and sopressata. For some, all of this meat might sound excessive, but the distribution and amount create a balance of cheese, meat and crust, making each chewy bite a pleasure.Guy Fieri has taste you can trust, proving himself once again with La Piazza al Forno. During peak dinner hours there will be a line out the door. If you want to avoid this, go for lunch the odds are you'll be seated right away.",nXNShGW4,2730

My favorite is Siphon Draw including the trek up to the Flatiron.  The ranger at the station felt bad for my puggle, saying that it was a tough hike for the animal, but I beg to differ, my little \animal\ pulled me up the mountain.  I recommend this park for families, dogs, and all types of hikers.  Also, make sure you bring your camera and start out early morning before sunrise to get great views.  Also, the park arranges a moonlight hike during a week of a fullmoon...I highly recommend this because the desert is so mysterious at night.  It has to do with the shadows from the moonlight I think.",q25C73G5,875

599,2.1,"The kids love this place.  There's something to do for everyone.  Zero entry pool with a water playground and tube slide for toddlers and young children makes it easy for parents to hang out to keep cool while they watch the kiddos.  The \spooky slide\ (tunnel) and white slide make up the two slides for older children.  I've seen them as young as 4 years old have the courage to go down both slides!  My little cutie pie's favorite is the white slide and diving pool.  We like to hang around the diving pool coz it stays really cool on super hot days.  Add the lazy river and the whirpool or vortex for the most inexpensive water park day.  Get there early to get the best shaded lawn chairs.  Some people like to bring their umbrellas, canopy and folding chairs.  There is also a partially covered fake grass turf if you want to lay your blankets or towels.  You can't bring those huge wheeled ice coolers.  You are allowed small 6 pack ones per person.  No cotton shirts allowed coz they clog up the water return.  Floaties have to be USCG (US Coast Guard) approved (a stamp on the device as proof) or they have a very limited supply you can borrow.  It is worth it to go to Target and get one for $19.  I remember when my little one could not swim yet, where I forgot his floatie,no one returned a life vest.  I kept checking until it was time to go home.There are showers you can rinse off in the bathrooms that are always kept pretty clean.  The entry fee is free for 1 year old and under, $1 for 2 to17 years old,  adults are $2.25, seniors 55 and over $1.25.   Sundays before 2pm in the summer are $1 for the whole family!

My last visit was not my normal experience with them. They were busy and there were about 10 of us however, the server was quite rude. There was one girl in our group that didn't eat because the server gave her attitude and she decided she didn't want anything that the server was going to bring her.  The server also refused to split checks for us even though we told her at the begining we were on seperate tabs. When the bill came most of us were paying with debit cards so it was a little nightmare. Like I said earlier, I have always liked this place, but this visit was not a good one. I'll be back again and hopefully we will never get that same server again.",YXkJJ8bH,3780
605,1.8,"Have had Jason's before at work luncheons and generally enjoyed the sandwiches and potato salad. Today my boyfriend and I ordered delivery and it was sadly disappointing. So here's why I'm only giving two stars. We ordered online, which was frustrating because we could not simply look at a menu. That option would not load for us and after trying for a while we decided to just try the \order now\ button. We had to put in all of our info first, then we got to see the menu. The menu was poorly edited and hard to read, not to mention confusing. I also feel like for what the descriptions were vs. what we actually received was pretty dissimilar. I ordered a California Turkey Club. There were two options to select on the website to add the sandwich to the order, with exactly the same description, the only difference being one had \Managers' Special\ in parenthesis. Not being able to discern the difference between the two I chose the latter and was later disappointed. My sandwich was literally 3 inches long, which is a shame because the three bites were pretty good.  The description said sprouts, avocado, tomato, and fresh greens among other things.  There were no sprouts, one slice of avocado, the butt end of one roma tomato and about five pieces of baby greens. I do have a positive though! For a side I had fruit salad, I really appreciated actual berries in the salad and not just melon like most places do. For paying over seven dollars I had expected a little bit bigger sandwich than kiddie size. My boyfriend ordered the small chicken pot pie and a roast beef sandwich. The sandwich was HUGE! Delicious roast beef with nice focaccia bread. The pot pie was sadly disappointing. It(the filling) came in a soup like cup, but with no pie. Instead they serve it with kind of like a small puff pastry tortilla. And it was so CHEESY which I really wish they would have put in the description because we aren't into cheese.  He had potato salad for a side which had eggshells in it. :/The chocolate nut brownie was amazing.  The plain cheesecake was amazing. The cream soda and black cherry sodas are also very good. Maybe next time will be better if we decide to try it again.",Y9x5DPlI,4761

608,3.9,"Hooters comes to mind when you think of a place like this. Yes. Hooters with hamburgers. Now that I think about it. Hooters and good food have nothing in common. Where as the Heart Attack Grill has pretty good burgers. But you know you're walking into a situation where the servers are going to be running with the theme of a hospital and be dressed as nurses. Let me quote Animaniacs and say  \Helloooooooooo Nurse!\ From the get go they tell you that eating here is not good for your health. It says it on the front of the door. It's like a cactus with spikes pointed out just telling you \This will hurt if you touch it!\ But hell, who doesn't want a hamburger named after a medical procedureYou walk in and the place is set up like a huge bar made out of a giant red cross logo in the middle. Inside of which the dressed in nurse gear servers take your order while sports play on television. This place is delightfully tacky. burgers vary and a bypass is considered a half pound patty. So there's a single bypass, double bypass, triple bypass and quadruple bypass. You get the deal. They have fries that are cooked with lard. Sounds healthy, right?It wasn't till about half way into the meal that I realized that the inner red cross symbol of a counter had mirrors that were angled up. This caught me off guard, like - wait, why am I looking up skirts while enjoying a burger? But sure enough they're there on purpose to give you a better view of the underwear of the waitresses. Oh man, that's when the misogyny was in full bloom, right? Before feeling like a tool of the Patriarchy I looked over at the margarita bar and there was two couples that had to be in their 70's or early 80's. All of them eating the single bypass. And I really just thought to myself that this place couldn't be so bad if they are able to attract those elderly people here. Either that or I need to rethink what I know about the elderly. This may be a case of Benny Hill syndrome and I'm just not hearing the Yakity Sax playing in the background.During the course of the meal they also had someone weigh in at the proper 350 pounds and surly enough, he got his food for free and the people in the place were screaming and egging him on. I would like to think that while they encourage you to let it all go. In fact making it so that if you suffer from Systemic and Diabetic II levels, you get your meal for free, that there's some sort of life lesson to be learned here.Maybe coming here and getting put center stage causes you to re-evaluate your weight problems. after your gluttonous burger and up-skirt adventure you'll change your ways.. So how was the food? The burger was really juicy for being a massive pound and a half of meat between the burns. It has a salad bar of condiments. So they pretty much give you the burger with bread and meat. You put the tomatoes and lettuce on it. I imagine they wouldn't want to encourage eating veggies. It would ruin their street cred. They have real bottled sodas here, so that's a plus. Over all, if you can get past the whole idea that they're encouraging obesity (Well, not really - just being honest about their food) and move past the fact that you have short skirt wearing servers, then it's a stop worthy venture to come out to the Heart Attack Grill.",WNfSL6Cw,910

611,3.8,"Went with friends for my wife's birthday dinner. The evening started off okay. Went to the front area to check-in and get our buzzer. Our friends hadn't arrived yet, so waiting wasn't going to be much of an issue. Told the girl that we would be having 6 total guests, but 2 were a surprise for my wife, so please make sure the staff doesn't say anything and to only have 4 place settings at the table. I also told her it was my wife's birthday and to do whatever they do special for birthdays. (Cheesy singing by the waitstaff included.)We went to the bar to have a drink while we waited. WAY overpriced drinks here. $16 for a Merlot and a pina colada. Strike 1.Our pager goes off so I go up to have the staff seat us. I remind the girl up front that the head count is a surprise for my wife's birthday. The hostes takes us to our booth and says \party of six?\ to which I replied to her o it's 4\. So, she went ahead and removed 2 of the 6 place settings. Strike 2.Our friends arrived shortly after we were seated. They were brought over to sit with us and we ordered our drinks and appetizers. Fried calamari and roasted artichokes were good. Everyone else also enjoyed the avocado rolls. So far, the food is showing some promise over the dumb staff.I ordered the chicken and sausage gumbo. Everyone else was half through their dinners before I got my dish. When it arrived, the only thing resembling gumbo was the rice. After the first taste, it was very bland and resembled some kind of creamy stew of unknown origin. Our waiter came by to ask if everything was okay, and how the gumbo was. After I told him it was so-so, he just asked \just okay?\, smiled and walked away. No checking to see if I wanted something else instead.About halfway through the gumbo, I started to not feel well. Our group ordered dessert, which they were all gushing over after it arrived. Unfortunately, the girl up front never shared with anyone that it was my wife's birthday. I had to say something to the waiter who smiled, said Happy Birthday, came back after 5 minutes with a couple of waitresses, none of which looked thrilled to be there, sang happy birthday, dropped off what was supposed to be a sundae, and walked away.After a bit, my face started to swell, I grabbed a waitress to ask if they happened to put clams in the gumbo, which I am severely allergic to. After checking with the chef, she came back to inform me that they put clam juice in it. Anyone who knows about gumbo knows that the classic recipe doesn't have any clams, or clam juice, in it. And, the menu has no claims of allergy causing foods.After a 20 minute ordeal of just trying to get the check so I could go get some pills from the nearby CVS, we were able to cash out and go. That was about the most embarassing and painful 20 minutes I've had in some time. When I first said something to the waitress, a woman came out from the back and simply said we're sorry, touched my shoulder, and went in the back again. Our waiter came by, asked if anyone came by to say anything, and saw that I was having trouble seeing the bill to split it. He offered to split the bill for us. At no time did he offer to get a manager to come talk to us. Shortly after the waiter left, a manager did come over after hearing what happened from the woman in the back. He offered to comp my gumbo and my wife's cheesecake.Count me out from ever stepping foot in this overpriced carnival of lousy food and mediocre cheesecake. I'm from NY, and I've had better cheesecake out of the freezer at Costco.The staff was nice enough, incompetent, but nice. Glad they offered an apology and to comp part of the meal, but I'm still upset that I had to pay anything after this ordeal.NOTE: IF YOU HAVE FOOD ALERGIES, MAKE SURE TO ASK BECAUSE IT WON'T BE ON THE MENU!!!",XhPTKzyJ,710

The food is decent. The drinks are decent. The staff are friendly. The atmosphere is not bad, but nothing spectacular. Back in the day, before we had Roosevelt and Lost Leaf (all of like, 6 months ago or something), this was unfortunately one of the only places consistently open late in downtown Phx, so I appreciate its place in history.

The manager, John, and staff are wonderful and always have a minute to \catch up\ with us and make us smile. We go there at least once a week.The music selection is great--most tunes are Puerto Rican salsa and merengue, sometimes with a few other surprises thrown in.

And, once I ate their if I found out they went without me (after I had gone back to Cali) I would get so upset!The location and exterior is very unassuming, actually you might miss it if you didn't know what you were looking for. It's tucked between a discount bread store and an Italian place in a slightly run down little strip mall. Initially, when you walk in it doesn't get much better... Its a hallway basically with about 8 tables that seat 2, 2 tables that seat four and a table all the way in the back that will seat 6-8. They also have about 14 seats at the bar. It's dark and in the summer it's WaRm too. But, once you grab a table (it can take time on a Fri or Sat night) you are in for some good eats. I love The Porky, Bangers & Mash & Carne Adovada. BF loves the Lamb & Mint. Friends of ours typically go for The Cottage Pie, Royale with Cheese or the Greek Chicken. Typically we stay with the \traditional pasties\, but I recently tried the Carne Adovada (considered a premium pasty) and it rocks. So, BASICALLY we've never been disappointed. And the red wine gravy that they serve on the side... Yeah, I could drink it (you will want to too). And while there are a TON of pastys to choose from... at least once you have to order their pasta salad (order it w/ chicken). Spinach, bow tie pasta, grape tomatoes, kalamata olives, onions, artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers and chicken tossed in a yummy pesto vinaigrette.This is a spot that we always hit early on a Sat or Sun... rarely are we interested in braving the Fri night crowd... And, don't go with more than 4 people unless you want to sit at the bar.Hard Cider and a pasty... my perfect Sunday afternoon.*I was torn on giving the CPC 4 or 5 stars because of their ti-ny seating capacity... but it adds to the character of the place.",PwFhUPqD,2583

The bread was crusty on the outside & chewy on the inside -very yummy.  We sat at the bar as we usually do and the bartender brought over a sample of their meet sauce to try with more bread.  I don't eat meat sauce but my husband said it was very good.  I had a heft cosmo & my husband had a beer.  For dinner i had the pasta trio that was fabulous - probably the best italian food i've had since the cioppino at Allesia's restaurant.  My husband had the linguine with white clam sauce also very good.  I'm certain these pasta dishes were homemade because they just had amazing flavor - I wanted more!! We finished with tiramisu that was also really great.  My husband had coffee and even that was great.  A little pricey in my opinion for italian food but due to how great all of it tasted -  we think it was worth it.  This will be a definite dining destination in the future.,mMiviBIF,297
624,1.8,"I cannot, in good faith, recommend this to anyone. My husband and I went there before a concert to celebrate our anniversary. I was really looking forward to a nice dinner. Unfortunately I got overpriced mediocrity. It all started from the moment we walked in the door. The hostess seated us in the middle of the relatively empty restaurant, where we sat, and sat, and sat waiting for someone to acknowledge that we were even there. After about fifteen minutes (seriously!), the hostess came over and poured what she thought was water and left (I'll give it to her that it was hard to tell it wasn't water, since the glasses are dark blue). What we actually got was iced tea. Unfortunately I hate iced tea and really, REALLY needed some water. It was a very warm day out and I was very dehydrated. We finally got a server to pass by about ten minutes later. His only comments to us were that he would be right with us. Really? After thirty minutes? At this point it was too late for us to go elsewhere, we were trapped. Our server finally came back to take our drink order, and we asked AGAIN for water (practically begging at this point). It took another request after that just to get water. We ultimately ordered our meals. My husband ordered the bone-in steak ($40). I ordered the crab cakes app and we shared the side of mac n cheese with bacon. My husband's steak was average at best. While it was cooked to temp, it lacked any seasoning whatsoever. The mashed potatoes that came with it however were very good. My crab cakes on the other hand were quite possibly the best crab cakes I've ever had. Very flavorful, despite their small size. The mac and cheese however was another story. I've never had such bland mac. How can something with bacon lack any flavor at all? It seems like the chefs had a competition to see who could make mac with less flavor. Winner got to serve their creation to us. Lucky us. Our server was consistently absent, and when he was in the area, he was obviously preoccupied with another table. The restaurant was practically dead, so I don't know why he was so inattentive. I was so disappointed when I left. Not only was my wallet $100 lighter, but I didn't get anything out of it. My husband said it best. \At least when I go to Capital Grille I know I'll spend this much money, but I'll feel like a king when I leave.\ Here, I felt like I was imposing on someone else the entire time.

626,4.8,this place really surprised me - from the outside it's a bit run down but it's very nice and clean inside.  it's also very reasonable - 2 games for 4 and shoe rental for $25.  there is also a small arcade area for non-bowlers and they have a decent selection of games.  there are also vending machines for quick drinks and snacks.  their snack bar was still closed when we got there so we weren't able to try any of the food that they serve.i would definitely go back to this bowling alley!,PieolSrY,855
627,3.3,"I've tried this place 3 times and I give up.  Major issues:  1.  Noise.  This is the loudest grooming facility I've ever seen.  I don't know how the employees put up with it.  Perhaps it is the narrow structure of the rented space itself.2.  Communication issues - my pet will be ready when?  I show up at the specified time, and not ready.  I'm told I will be called.  I wait, and wait, and wait.... and finally call back to find out that my pet has been ready for quite some time and they're wondering why I didn't pick him up sooner since I was so impatient.3.  Some staff don't have a full deck.  I should be cautious here, because maybe she has a disability, but the person who seems to always take my pet and money isn't \with it\.

The small salad was huge and they put a full piece of fish on it. My husband had a sandwich that offered nice flavors. It's a nice twist on common American cuisine. The atmosphere was decent. It's modern and they play background electronic music that is a little loud for the dinner crowd. They also had a big screen with artist lighting that blasted on the faces of whomever happened to sit in front of the big screen. That would annoy me if I sat there,UWnhACUF,2940

634,1.7,"Only thing keeping this place from 5 stars is a few nitpicks about my meal.  It was good though and I will go again.  But read on.*Service:  TOP NOTCH!!  From the moment I walked in the door the girl that noticed me walk in jumped up and came on over..gave me a couple options of where I wanted to sit, I chose to sit at the \bar.\  They set me up with a tasty sweet tea right away.  Delicious it was.  My waitress was attentively awaiting my order, but in no way pushy.  She was busy at the time I closed my menu, but someone else was right there and asked me if they could start something cooking for me.  By all means they could.  She came back...told her someone had already started it and what I ordered.  Food came out and all was well.*Food:  Good, plenty, and quality.  I had a pretty good plate of food in front of me for $8 (of course, not counting drink or tip).  Chicken seasoning/batter was quite tasty.  My only nit here is that the chicken was a little dry.  It did fall off the bone...but was just a little dry.  The sweet tea and excess syrup on the plate were excellent for addressing this issue though.  Plus, some chicken and waffle bites together was actually not bad.  The waffle itself was quite fluffy and quality made.  My only nitpick with the waffle is aside from the butter provided, the waffle itself had a very buttery flavor to it.  There was nothing wrong with it...just wasn't quite expecting it...and it didn't seem that the syrup was very sweet...so it just tasted very buttery (if I'd realized that, I probably would not have used the whole dollop of butter that was there).  BUT...it was a quality meal and tasty.  I will visit again.Conclusions:  As I was finishing up, I was offered more sweet tea by my very attentive but not annoying or pushy waitress.  I had her give me half a glass.  As I was putting the bill together, a guy behind the counter (manager perhaps?) offered to fill it up before I left.  I declined...but I must say...I really, really enjoyed the customer attention and service.  So many places lack this.  It was a delight and a pleasure to patronize LoLo's Chicken and Waffles.",KlgfQNfs,2744
635,1.5,"*****MOVED TO 8140 N. Hayden Rd. in ScottsdaleIndian Cuisine is my nose, mouth and eye's favorite food.  Although my stomach sometimes would disagree mildly.  But I don't care!  It's worth it!  Upon entering Tandoori Times, located next to the brand new \Forbidden\ night  club on 5th avenue in Old Town, Scottsdale, I notice what I like to call an Honesty Kitchen.  (The first thing I noticed, was the familiar fragrances one always smells upon entering and Indian Restaurant).  I have never seen an Honesty Kitchen in an Indian Restaurant.  It was Amazing!  Not only can you watch the chef's skewering the meats and vegetables on the long spikes and placing them into the enormous tandoor ovens, you can also see them do little dances as they cook.  I enjoyed watching them just a bit more than the belly Dancer (on busier nights), although she was just darling.  I avoided her whenever possible.Back to the food- You can find the usual fare of  Naan, Tandoori, masalas, chutney as well as a bevy of vegetarian favorites.  Each time I have been into the restaurant i was met by the gracious owner, Sonny, who has greeted me kindly.  His friendly and surprisingly knowledgeable staff are equally welcoming.  The patio is roomy but last I checked, needed some attention.I would probably not dine here then go to Forbidden for all  night dancing, but that's just me.  Instead, I would recommend the opposite.  You may not find what you want at the Clubs, but you will find it at Tandoori Times.",tZs7cxx1,1054

Two of my friends were chatting away while I silently cherished my gelato. By the time they noticed I hadn't been joining in the conversation like usual, I had polished off my little gelato cup! I had two flavors packed into that little petal cup -- a delish cherry gelato and a nutella gelato. My friend had blueberry, which was so intensely flavored of blueberries ... it was better than even eating the actual fruit! And our other friend had everything chocolate -- which was two rich flavors that were deep and dark.Arleccchino is a must when you're visiting Arizona, so make sure you stop on by.

Just keep in mind, I didn't eat there. But I did see the food. And I'm SO going back for the food.I chanced into here based on a quick iPhone Yelp search for \wine\. I'd actually been looking for a wine store, so it goes to show you how much I'd read. Upon arrival, my friend and I decided that even if we couldn't buy a bottle to depart with, the atmosphere was pleasant enough to stick around for. You know, for a glass of wine.We sit at the nice dark wood bar and the bartender sweeps over. My friend was undecided on her choice and, on my suggestion, asked the bartender.This was the best choice made that day. By anyone. Anywhere.The somo....somma.....sumal.....wine guy asked her about her tastes and preferences (red, non-specific) and gave her a few tastes. A bit more conversation and he recommends going for the \Discovery\ flight. This turns out to be a fantastic idea for her. A spectrum of red wine was put before her and she was left in a state of bliss.The....wine guy turns to me and asks about my tastes (red zinfandels, the \real\ ones, as I found out), but I'm open to trying new wines. He thinks on it for a second and mutters a few possibilities while he looks at the shelf of wine behind the bar. Inspiration strikes, and he pulls out a pinot noir. Strange, but I'll go along with it. It was the damnedest thing, but if it wasn't a pinot noir that has a lot of the earthy characters that I love in red zin.So that was how the night went. By the time I left there, with the good-matured feeling that wine gives you, I had been thoughroughly educated in all sorts of things about wine.  I actually even found out that the winery that sells one of my favorite zins has \sold out\. Sad, but always good to know.In short: Go here now! Sit at the bar with your friend(s) and talk to the (asks Mr.Internet) sommelier! and enjoy some fantastic service and, of course, wine.",vog6Souc,3044

Yet on Amazon.com you could stream it for $1.99 each using their 'on demand' feature.

There are a ton of local movies and random documentaries available for \watch now\, but then something that should be available for streaming just isn't. -there's no reason why, no way to request it, and no way to say to Netflix \hey, I was watching that yesterday, why isn't it available today?\.

Take advantage of the service!\  We went to our seat and after we pressed the service button, someone came within a few minutes.  There was a full menu at our fingertips...including alcohol and specialty coffees.  Our seats were comfortable, leather (or pleather), roomy, we could stretch out our legs without touching the chairs in front of us, we had 3 cup holders between the both of us, and the seats leaned back.  Not a bad seat in the theater...we got to pick our seats BEFORE we went into the movie on a touch screen computer/pad.  I'm really impressed with the prices, too, because for just $2 more than a regular, cramped, loud, teenager-infested movie theater, we felt like we were getting First Class treatment, all night!  The snack, food and drink prices are typical for a movie theater; but not more than it would be elsewhere.  Pretzel was about $4.50 and Hummus was about $6.50 for example.  I'm sad to read Ruth Ann's review because it sounds like an isolated incident, and it also sounds like they did a lot to take care of the issues she had...an experience can't be absolutely perfect.  In my case, there was a little bit of stickiness near my cup holder, but that's not something that will bring my experience down an entire star or 3! Go to this theater!

It doesn't really even seem like the food is made in a New Mexican style of preparation.  It's more like New Mexican as seen through a Sonoran filter.  I mean no disrespect to Sonoran style Mexican food, it's tasty as well.But the green chile sauce I've had smothered over, and within, various dishes at my fave NM spots has a lot more green chile in it and is NOT merely a greenish gravy with green onions and pork (or beef).  The essence of the sauce should be green chile and not over compensated, or embellished with too many spices otherwise.  Thus, the meal I had at Arriba was lackluster.  I had huevos rancheros.  The potatoes were warm and stale as if they'd been sitting for a spell.  The refried beans could have been canned and I wouldn't have known the difference.  Even the  cheese was bland.I've been here twice expecting to be knocked off my seat with a NM/green chile flavor explosion.

660,2.1,"I will be the first to admit that I'm not much of a fan of Sam Fox.  Admittedly style-over-substance, his restaurants always seem to be popular and get points for style, but usually fail to deliver when it comes to the food.  I had a couple great meats at Zin Bistro (now gone) in Tucson, an awesome meal at Greene House after they opened, and Bloom, early on, but every experience since then at North, Olive and Ivy and Sauce have really let me down.  Zinburger, to be sure, was not a place I had on my radar.  So when I was invited to join someone for a free lunch during opening week, how could I say no?  I ordered the \Samburger* - $10 Nueske's Applewood Smoked Bacon, American Cheese & Thousand Island Dressing\, truffle fries and a date shake.  Why should you go to Zinburger?  The truffle fries.  Beautifully crisp fries, with a light drizzle of truffle oil, served with a truffle aioli.  I picked up the truffle flavor and aroma from both the fries and the aioli, and enjoyed every second of eating them.  The burger, on the other hand, which is supposedly why you'd come to this joint, was just okay.  While the burger was cooked to desired medium-rare, it was under-salted and lacked the beefy depth I was looking for.  Underneath the burger was shredded iceberg lettuce, which wilted to a limp mess as it sat there on the plate.  The bun, while soft and fresh, lacked the structure necessary to support a juicy burger, and became soggy half-way through.  I thought the date shake was okay, but I had a hard time picking up the date flavor through the sweet vanilla iced cream. I'd go back to Zinburger for the fries, to be sure.  I'd probably even give the burger another shot, since I've only had one.  But I'm just skeptical on FRC restaurants' ability to deliver food I'm going to want to come back for.  Maybe it's just me.  Judge for yourself.",eW1TpLJu,608
661,2.5,"Let me begin this review by apologizing in advance, to all I offend and the other previous yelpers who have reviewed this establishment with such high regards.My companion and I were greeted by a warm welcome by hostess and immediately seated at our table.  My first impressions of the waiter was that he was both friendly and attentive, that would be the saving grace(if any) of this experience.  While there were many open booths and tables, we were seated in between two older couples in the back of the restaurant. It was so quiet, I asked our waiter if we were allowed to talk.  We ordered the bottled water service and received our menus.  Upon receipt of the menu, my eyes lit up.  There were so many dynamic choices and eye catching listings, that I was having trouble deciding upon both my appetizer and entree.I ordered a dirty grey goose martini with extra olives and my companion a glass of Cabernet.  My martini was not dirty at all, which made it somewhat enjoyable as it was just chilled vodka,  but the blue cheese olives were abundant and phenomenal.   Our first course arrived and we had decided to share the sweetbreads and the vegetable risotto.  I was a few bites in when it dawned on me that I was about to have an \Avalon\ moment.  An exhilarating menu with food that falls infallibly short.  The sweetbreads were covered in some charred type substance neither of us could make out. The sweetbreads were tough and had absolutely no seasoning. The lack of seasoning would become a trend of the entire evening.  The vegetable risotto is not listed or advertised correctly.  It is a small layer of sauce, a few kernels of arborio rice and a pile of vegetables.  I like vegetables as well, but when I am ordering risotto, I would actually like the starch as well.  The risotto needed more than a few pinches of salt and the sweetbreads were inedible.  I thought at this point, that the entrees we had ordered would save the day.  I would be wrong.  My companion ordered the house specialty, the squab.  In my twenty five years of dining, I have never been so embarrassed for a kitchen, as i was for this kitchen, when the food was tasted.  The squab was supposed to be a two legs, confit style, and two breasts that were roasted.  Oh my.  How this dish was able to leave the kitchen I will never quite understand.  It was entirely undercooked, gamey, unseasoned, uncuttable and overall ghastly, just ghastly.  My scallops looked appealing, but for a thirty-two dollar price tag, I was hoping for a bit more than four scallops and a small stack of greens.  Nevertheless, i forged ahead and gave it a try.  The scallops were undercooked, underseasoned(see a trend here?), and utterly tasteless.  My dining partner and I stared at each other for a few moments before we started laughing. One of the best parts about having a really bad meal is that you get to joke about it for a while and the bad meal repays itself in comedy.  That would not be the case here.  When the bill was brought to me and I opened to review, my mouth hit the floor.  Fifteen dollars for that crappy martini? Fourteen dollars in water? We figured that one out, that the waiter brought us a new bottle at the end of the meal, without us asking us and the bottle remained 95% full, but we were charged an additional seven dollars for it.  The bill of $154 dollars, was an outrage to say the least. The squab was inedible, the scallops a disaster, and the appetizers a joke.Sorry for bursting the bubble for people on this one, but my recommendation is to PASS.",JtogABqT,2822

When we walked in there was not a single other person in the place at noon.  It smelled like Clorox bleach was used on everything.  After we sat down we were greeted with the smell or sewage because there was a truck pumping out the bathrooms.  The service was very slow even though we were the only ones there.If this wasn't enough when we asked about the wing challenge they said they don't do it anymore but they still serve the wings.  Hoping to save this terrible lunch trip we still ordered them.  It took over 20 min to get 4 orders of boneless wings out to us.  The wings were not hot at all.  They tasted like Tyson's frozen buffalo wings that had been cooked and the tossed some sliced jalapenos on them for effect.  There was not heat at all I have had mild wings at other places that are hotter.Over all I would avoid this place at all costs.  It was a dump and smelled like one and the food was terrible.

677,4.5,"DIM SUM suckas! DIM SUM.Dim Sum is the greatest thing to hit food since teeth.I have been holding off on writing this Yelp for months now.  I just could not figure out a way to wrap my head around the awesomeness that is Dim Sum.  I have been eating here pretty much every weekend since I was first introduced to it by fellow Yelpers Jenn H. and  Scott S.  Joe Crack played a role in the introduction as well.  Joe Crack is not a Yelper (He should be though.) but he is a wizard.  So you should be willing to take the suggestion of someone so wise in the ways of the world. He also coined the phrase o Goddamn BBQ pork bun!\ Which turns out to be a useful phrase when having Dim Sum, cause they try to shove that down your throat from every cart that comes strolling by.The absolute greatest thing about Dim Sum is the ability to be eating awesome food within seconds of sitting down.  From the moment you sit down they are coming by with carts of amazing, trying to get you to try everything from BBQ pork bun to Chicken feet.  You could, if you were so inclined, be in and out of the place in 15 minutes and have a belly full of really tasty Chinese food bits. Some of my favorite things are:The Chinese BroccoliThe Spring rollsThe Curry meat TrianglesThe pot stickersAnd...My absolute favorite is the Sticky rice. If you go to Dim Sum you have to get the sticky rice.  It is a ball of rice wrapped in a lotus leaf.  Then Jesus and Buddha get together and cry tears of joy over the amazing creation. Then Luke Skywalker and Captain Kirk bless it with a light saber and Tricorder. Then Kurt Cobain plays a misunderstood song over it. Then right before it gets to your table the entire restaurant does a rendition of \Be our Guest\ from Beauty and the Beast as Pamela Anderson and Jenna Jameson deliver it while talking in tongues.  It is that good people.",3Wgaz3uz,1560

As far as coffee goes, this place was ok.  I got an iced mocha with an extra shot (on the recommendation of the barista when I said I was from NYC and needed some \good shit.\).  The people were very nice there.  The coffee though...I've had better.  Sorry.  But the kicker was the peanut butter bacon chocolate chip cookie.  Well all righty.

687,4.6,"This studio was amazingly convenient for me, so after I discovered Pilates (thanks to a good friend in Ohio who is an amazing Pilates instructor) I was thrilled to find a studio so close to my house. I tried a class first in January 2011. But my budget wouldn't let me sign up. So this year when my budget did allow, I went to another class. While I wasn't thrilled at the non-traditional aspect of this studio (she encourages her students to wear shoes on the reformers), I was getting a good workout. Somehow, somewhere along the line, Kathy apparently found something I said or did to be worthy of dumping me from her studio. She did not bother to discuss any issue with me; she just sent me an email saying not to come back to class and asking where to send my refund.So if you're looking for a more traditional Pilates studio, this isn't the studio for you. After discussing this issue with my Ohio Pilates-instructor friend, she says I'm better off going to a \real\ Pilates studio. I find it quite a shame that this owner didn't even bother to discuss whatever the issues are so we could communicate through it. I wish Kathy well. Maybe in the future she'll actually discuss issues with her students before those issues get to the point of being kicked out. For those of you reading this who are confident, assertive, and ask questions, this might not be the studio for you.",34bAatCB,2033

They usually have several different varieties.The place has always been run by really nice people, but the new owners are the nicest people yet.About a month ago, I was on the way home from visiting my cousin in the hospital when my growling stomach let me know that no food for 12 hours was not making it happy....  I ran into the store at 6:45 pm.  They close at 7.The owners were at the front counter.... \You're hungry,\ said the woman looking at me with concern\yes,\ I nodded  \Can I get a Gyro, or is it too late.\She looked at her husband... \she's hungry,\ she said to him... He hesitated.\She's hungry!\ the wife repeated...I knew they had probably cleaned up already and were getting a sandwich even though it was inconvenient.  I was so grateful.  It was the best Gyro I have EVER had...  I stop there about once a week now, on my way home from the hospital.  I get a few groceries and something for dinner.

690,1.4,"A great taco spot can be judged by the salsa. I pony up to the La Condesa salsa bar and prepare to judge. Today's salsa varieties included strawberry, cilantro, guac, and my fav a spicy salsa with tamatillios. Spicy, complex, AUTHENTIC, developed flavors exploded in my mouth as I sampled a rainbow of salsa with the chips that arrive before my tacos. Instantly, I could tell,  La Condesa Gourmet Taco Shop knows what they're doing in the kitchen, they care about quality, and are super fresh.  If Mexican food can be judged by salsa, a good Mexican restaurant can also be judged by the frijoles. These beans did not disappoint. Great flavor, perfect consistency, delicious salty cheese on top. MMMMM! The Main Event: Tacos. Yay! Roasted Veggies: Awesome! Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco: WOAH! My lunch buddy declared: \This is as good as my favorite taco stand in Mexico!\ (She lived there for 6 years!) How's that for authentic?! The Horchata may be the best in town. Definitely homemade, with strawberries, mmmmm. Not too sweet or watery. I can not wait to try the fried quesidillias.  With food this delicious, decor may not matter, however the inside is cozy & clean with heavy wooden tables and contemporary chicano art. I especially love the doors to the banos. Prices are completely fair, cheaper than a combo at a chain restaurant. Meal for two with drinks was $20.Taco Row is one reason i struggle with the thought of leaving the southwest. Salsa and tacos this phenomenal are difficult to recreate too far from the border. La Condesa, the new kid on the block, is worthy of praise & adoration.  i look forward to a long, delicious affair.",bghYFdiz,1790

Both of those starters are heaven in your mouth or least they were in my mouth...hahaha...Then you have to try the wood fired mussels and the \b\ burger...OMG I absolutely love the Houtons and Delux burger but this now is a tie for my favorite!  The mussels are just as amazing.  If you are a mussel fan and you like to dip the bread in the broth you will die!  You will just want to keep asking for the toast that they give you!  Just know if you fill up on bread you will not have enough room for dessert!  I tried the chocolate dipped bacon smores!!!! OOOOOOO--MMMMMMMM-GGGGG!!  You may think that this sounds kind of off...but just think...the salty taste of bacon with the sweet taste of chocolate and caramel and marshmellow...it is to die for...just try it...it may sound a little interesting but I promise you that you will not be disappointed or upset!  I had a miss katies pimms cup and it was delicous and refreshing! I want to come back and try new things!  This might need to become a new place of mine!  I love it and it deserves to be on of the best restaurants in the valley!  I love the atmospshere and our waitress was so sweet and she really helped us pick good food.

692,3.7,"It's been a while since we've been here and we got here by ways of Infiniti. We were getting the oil changed on my husband's car (or something else equally mundane) and a salesman kept trying to get us to test drive a new car but we had no interest. He finally sweetened the deal with a Ruth's Chris gift card. Long story short, we drove the car, got the gift card, got our car back and went to dinner. We got there and sat at the bar and enjoyed a couple of glasses of champagne and scotch before we moved to our seats. I've got to say, this is the only location I've been so I can't speak for the ambiance of others, but this one is sorely lacking. The lighting is bright, it feels overly open and the air conditioner was blowing full force. We started with the wedge with blue cheese. It was as expected. Iceberg with bacon and blue cheese. Hard to screw up. Tastes good. I don't remember was cut if steak we ordered but I was talked into getting the butter on my plate. Huge mistake. It just made it overly rich. I also can't say I'm a fan of the searing hot plate. It made my medium rare steak progressively more cooked. If it has to go in either direction, I prefer it to be rarer. My husband wanted the au gratin potatoes so we shared an order of those. Here's another one of my beef's. Sometimes restaurants equate richness (butter and cream) with flavor and goodness, which they are, but they stop there. They load up the potatoes au gratin with sticks of butter and pints and heavy whipping cream and think, \Viola! I have created a masterpiece!\ but in reality they're just rich and really don't have much flavor. You can probably tell I didn't think much of them. For desert we ended up with the chocolate sin cake and the creme brulee. Both were OK but so are the frozen deserts from Trader Joe's. I'd say they were on par with those. OK when I'm paying $4.99 for two and preparing them myself. Not so much when buying one in a restaurant. Nothing was bad at Ruth's Chris, I was disappointed to find that nothing stood out as phenomenal. Next time I'll stay home and make some steaks myself, we'll eat them in our pajamas with a bottle of wine them watch some Mad Men. Now that's a good evening.",eBM03gI7,1169

696,4.2,"A large national group to which I belong recently stayed at the Radisson where this restaurant resides.   I personally stayed at the hotel for three nights.   During the first evening, a group of 6-8 of us decided to dine in this restaurant.   There were parts of our overall dining experience that were quite good--the bruschetta (as it was unusual--in a good way--from the typical that is normally served).   Most people at our table enjoyed there meals.   I am not one to really complain and really try to look at the bright side of all situations.  This dining experience, for me, was entirely different.   My dining experience was one-star at best.  I gave two stars to be fair to the establishment and the wait person as others did enjoy most of their meals.   Regarding my starter--I think I've had milk that was thicker in consistency than the watered-down, no taste, butternut squash soup.   For my main course, I ordered a cobb salad as it was late and I didn't want a terribly heavy meal. I waited....waited....and waited some more to the point where everyone had not only finished their main courses, but were embarrassed that I didn't have mine.  Clearly, the wait person did not place the order for this salad.  The story we heard was that the hard boiled egg on the \first\ salad they prepared for me was overdone.   The salad that did arrive had a hard boiled egg that was absolutely runny--as if I was eating a sunnyside-up egg at breakfast.   I can tell you that it's the first time I've ever seen that served on a cobb salad.  To make a longer story short, there wasn't an apology nor any offer to make the situation right by the customer.  Instead, I received my bill and paid the full price.  I am thinking that I will never go back.",pxb2YDDV,969

704,4,"My husband and I got married at the Phoenix Art Museum last month. This is a review of the museum as a wedding venue.The Phoenix Art Museum is a fabulous place to get married. You can have your ceremony in the courtyard, in the modern art gallery (which is what we did), in the front lobby, or on the front steps by the fountain. They have an enormous hall for the reception.Pros:- It has that modern, not-at-all Southwest feel that my husband and I were looking for.- They do a couple of weddings a year, so they know what they're doing, but they aren't simply a wedding factory. None of our guests had ever been to a wedding there, so it felt unique and special.- There are so many amazing locations for individual, couple, and group photos.- The event managers, Heather and Jackie, were great. They got back to me quickly when I had a question; they included my husband in the process; they were professional and friendly; they thought of the little details that helped everything flow seamlessly.- If you have your ceremony in the gallery, as we did, there's a big staircase for a dramatic entrance.- You can have your ceremony and reception in the same place, so your guests don't have to spend time traveling.- The guys' ready room is behind a secret sliding wall. My husband got a kick out of that.Cons:- It's $500 for the ceremony and $4,500 for the reception, so it's a little pricey.- You have to use their bartender, ARTenders, so you don't have much flexibility to keep alcohol costs down. - You have to use one of their preferred caterers, but they have a long list. We went with Santa Barbara Catering, and they were fabulous.- The marble floor can get a little uncomfortable for dancing in heels. We put out a bunch of flip flops in a variety of colors and sizes (labeled \Sandals of Relief\), which were a big hit.- The ladies' ready room isn't that attractive for the getting ready photos.- When you're doing walk-throughs and meeting with vendors, you have to pay $10 admission, but they're free on Wednesdays.Overall, we are so very happy we got married at the Phoenix Art Museum. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a unique, beautiful wedding location.",muRynhrT,3159

709,4.7,We purchased a \large room\ for three hours for my birthday - and it was a terrible experience.  I thought it would be perfect because my friends love to karaoke (and drink) -- but the service was terrible and the microphones/karaoke machine continually stopped working.  At one point - it took the guy a half hour to \fix\ the machine... when you consider it's $150.00 an hour - that was $75.00 we spent to just sit in a room and watch a guy attempt to get the machine to work.  Not to mention we were told that we would receive large sushi platters -- and the waitress just \thought we didn't want them\.  After we finally got the platters - other people wanted to order food and the \kitchen was closed\.  Would have been nice to get service/sushi right at 10:30 when we showed up.  Not to mention the $600+ bill that we had to figure out how to split ourselves (even though we were willing to pay as we go...).  The service was terrible.This place ruined my birthday.

The office manager should be fired yesterday.Our insurance company assigned this office-shaped toilet to us for our dental needs, so we went in for a cleaning.  A few days later, cavity fillings.  And a week or so after that, wisdom teeth removal.  Why did we keep going back you ask?  I have no idea.  Perhaps it was the devil in me that kept saying, \This must be a one-time deal.  Nobody is this incompetent.\  The devil in me is a liar.Each appointment, they'd call the day before to confirm the appointment time.  EACH time, they quoted a wrong time.  So we'd say fine, we'll just go at the time you're telling us we were supposedly scheduled for.  Then, each visit, we'd get there and the lady at the front desk would tell us a completely different time than 1) what we had actually scheduled, and 2) what the lady confirming on the phone gave us.  Needless to say, we spent a lot of time stewing in corners waiting for our names to be called over these three visits.  And to add insult to injury, they actually charge YOU if you're late.  There's a word for that.  I'm sure I'll think of it later.On the third visit, while my wife was getting her wisdom teeth out, the billing dept. came out twice after I'd paid to tell me they'd screwed up and hadn't charged me the right amount.  I began to wonder if I should be in the room with my unconscious wife.  Images of an amateur surgeon with a perplexed expression on his face saying, \Oops.  One more do-over...\ flitted through my mind.So after paying for each visit and enduring the rampant idiocy, we'll never have to deal with them again.  False!  I got a bill in the mail from them saying I owe several hundred dollars with only \Balance Forward\ for an explanation, that it's been due over 90 days, and we also owe them late fees.Judas Priest, Elegant Smile.

The Original sandwich and the turkey breast sandwich are my two absolute favorites here. There sourdough bread is baked fresh daily and is very good. The molasses wheat bread is also good if you are in to avoiding white flour.  I am a big sandwich junkie when it comes to lunch when I am working. I work 15 minutes away from this place but it is worth the drive to have one of there delicious sandwiches. The medium sandwich is equivalent to a large in my opinion. I always get the small since I am a female and find the medium to be too much. You guys out there could better finish the medium. Then there large sandwich is for those who have a serious appetite and seem to have skipped breakfast. This place does get very busy between 11:30-1 inside.

The hotel is beautiful and the restaurant is right off of a lounge on the lower level. It has an open feel to it but because it to open to the lounge area it was a little noisy at times. It wasn't a problem at all for me but if you want a quite dinner it could be disturbing.The food was excellent. I had a filet mignon which was prepared exactly as I requested and my wife had a different steak that she also liked. The food has a Southwest flare and some can be spicy. We split a salad which was plenty for us and we got a bottle of wine. Service was good but not excellent (for a restaurant in this price range).

Bunch of kids running around while I stood there waiting. Finally one of the ladies caught my eye and helped me out. I don't necessarily expect top class service at a bagel shop but at least a greeting or acknowledgement is all I ask.

724,2.2,"I called ahead to see what time they closed and found out the drive-thru stays open until 9pm which was a bonus.  When I arrived I ordered the Hummus Veggie Wrap and a smoothie.  The hummus wrap was unexpectedly spicy, nice surprise!  Since I couldn't decide on a smoothie, I decided to \make my own\.  I mixed strawberry lemonade with peach & pineapple.  So good!  I loved the sandwich: chock full 'o veggies and spicy!  I wish there was a location in Scottsdale!",0KnX1nBm,2212
725,4.2,The food is always very good.  Not incredible but always very good.  I've been there 6 times now and have never had anything subpar.  I have never seen a spec of dirt.  I have never gotten a wrong order.  The thing that makes The Blue Fin incredible is the service.  I have never seen a group of people who take more pride in serving their customers.  They are some of the kindest people you could possible meet.  How many times do you hear an owner ask if you want more food on your plate while you are staring at a huge mound of meat and rice?  Not said to try and get you to buy more food but because tell she was worried there wasn't enough chicken there.  The portions are hefty for the price,U4DkoHzw,3389
726,1.2,I would definitely give them a try. I got the large shrimp po'boy and I was stuffed. The fries were hot and fresh and the sandwich was tasty. I tried my aunt's rice and beans and they were really good unlike what I expected from the other reviews I read. The people were very nice and the lunch prices were good. Dinner is more money but maybe they increase the portion size. I'm not sure. Also they give a 20% military discount on the whole order and my aunt has a military I.d. So that worked out. I'd go again for sure.,6aG92Nok,4154

734,1.6,"I have been Chipotle faithful for about 2 years now, and it wasn't very difficult.  Restaurants such as Rubio's and the Blue Burrito just didn't stack up to a Chipotle burrito.  Then came Qdoba.This restaurant is pretty much a carbon copy of Chipotle (2 of the employees on duty actually worked at my former Chipotle of choice).  I had a chicken burrito (my Chipotle norm) so I could make as direct of a comparison as possible.  The food was great, and afterwards I didn't get that \punched in the stomach\ feeling that Chipotle gives me for some time after I eat it (I am convinced their rice expands in your stomach, but it tastes good so I suffer through it).  I also picked up their frequent customer swipe card (buy 10 burritos get one free + free chips and salsa after activation).  This place is closer to my place than any Chipotle, so I will be coming very often! P.S. If anyone if privy to the correct pronunciation let me know!(ku-doh-ba???)",jDlBMSj9,435

The only reason I didn't notice is because it took so long for you to get my order out to me.  I was just glad to get my order.This Filiberto's is no different than any other one around the Valley.  There all about the same with maybe a couple being better than others.  This one is run of the mill.  They do have awesome 'brown' salsa here.  I asked the guy for the other salsa and he said, \The brown one?\.  Yeah.24 Hours.  Cheap.  Relatively quick.  No biggie.",Xi7WHkN5,1991
744,5,"Half Moon is \A-OK\ as my 3 star Rating suggests.It's a very decent sports bar in my hood, so I'm happy to report that they carry some good brews and have some decent beer specials.They currently have $3 Mirror Pond pale ale and porter bottles all day every day, which is pretty awesome.For food, we enjoyed their Mozzarella sticks, which are pretty good, except for the price ($9). Luckily, it was happy hour so they were half price at the time, which is about what they're worth. I can't imagine paying $9 for mozzarella sticks normally.Since I'm all veggie all the time, my entree choices there are limited. Basically I can choose from a salad, a grilled cheese or a pasta primavera.This time, I opted for the pear gorgonzola salad, which I have also enjoyed on a previous occasion.  It really is a delicious salad, with mixed greens, candied pecans, pear slices, gorgonzola cheese crumbles all topped with a dressing of sweet vinagrette & oil. I do wish the salad had a bit more pear on it.So what makes them just \A-OK\, well, our service was pretty lackluster on this occasion. The waitress took a long time to make her initial visit after we were seated. I'm talking at least 10 minutes, maybe 15. After that, she disappeared for long periods of time, including when we were ready to pay our bill. The place was busy though, but I didn't see her helping other people, just not being around. This may have just been an isolated incident though, as our service has been just fine there in the past.The other problem they had today was that they were \out of stock\ of their highly touted $3 Mirror Pond pale ales, which was exactly what we wanted.I'd also like to see other veg-friendly item on the menu, like a veggie burger or something else.I'm sure I'll be back, I just hope that they're not out of stock of their #1 beer special and that the service is better next time.",T0pX3KqH,3426
745,2,"One of the reasons I tried this hotel is that the airport shuttle I use from the Verde Valley has dropped several people off here every time I've used the shuttle. So I thought I'd try it. Had I written this in the first 10 minutes I was on the property, this would have been 1 star. The front desk clerk left me standing at the front desk during check in for five minute...twice...to answer the phone in another room. I HATE that ~ it's one of my customer service pet peeves. She didn't smile, or apologize, or even make eye contact with me during the entire, long check-in process. The room was wonderful and deserves 5 stars ~ the bed was comfy, the room offered a \clean remote\ with the flat-screen TV. I had a first floor room and there was no noise from the parking lot, the upper floors or even the planes from the airport. I loved that unlike other hotels that don't start breakfast till 6:00 when I often need to be at the airport before that, they had a great selection of coffees, teas, fruit, cookies and crackers available beginning at 3am!! The shuttle was ontime, and the room was competitively priced. I will definately stay here again.",nSQo4Oag,1067

747,2.5,\Kincaid's Always Pleases\ - Five of us went for an early dinner and as always Kincaid's pleases. The BBQ Baby Back Ribs Hawaiian Style with Sweet Potato Fries and Cole Slaw was incredible! A full rack with sweet glazed crust on the surface clinging to chunks of moist tasty meat was too much for me to eat alone so I shared with my friends. Everyone loved them! The slaw was a bit unusual with several ingredients I couldn't makeout. It was okay.  I love the sweet potatoe fries. It was a perfect combo of flavors with iced tea which had a touch of mango or something exotic... very good!My friends had the Halibut Grilled delicious as always. Another had the Salmon served atop a mountain of potato. He was very please and also ordered the side of asparagus which was perfection. Another had the house specialty Salt incrusted Prime Rib and he scored an end cut which was huge and delicious! Phillip took good care of us as we lingered over dinner conversation for over two hours. Once again Kincaid's reminded me why it is my favorite downtown fine dining restaurant.,ux7RFwCj,978

750,2.2,"I finally made it to The Parlor!  I first saw a sign for it in one of my regular hangouts, Nellos.  Flash forward several months and one of my friends suggested it for dinner as part of our 'girls weekend\ at the Biltmore.  After a day of spa treatments and pool time, all four of us were very excited to go to dinner.Walking in, the place was hopping and the staff was welcoming.  We put our names down for a 20-minute wait and put in an order for a bottle of wine (after some kind recommendations from the manager).After about 10 minutes, we were sitting at our table talking to our very friendly and personable server.  He noticed that one of my friends was pregnant (not sure if it was the belly or the lack of a wine glass that tipped him off) and mentioned that his wife was due any day which sparked a nice conversation of baby names and foot massages.The worst part of my Parlor experience was trying to decide what I wanted.  It all sounded so delicious, I wanted (ok, still want) one of everything.  For appetizers we decided on Frito Misto (Crispy Calamari & Rock Shrimp) and Arancini (fried Crispy Saffron Risotto balls filled with Fontina).  Both were good, not earth-shattering, but good!  My favorite part (for both dishes) was the sauce that came with it.For our meal, we split a large Spinach Salad (quite yummy and almost knocked out by the beet salad, but spinach won in the end) and a Funghi pizza.  One anti-mushroom friend did a \build your own pizza.\  I didn't try a slice of her pizza, but I did get a chunk of the sausage and it was delicious.  Great seasoning and texture, very fresh.  We were raving about it so much one of my (mostly) vegetarian friends had to try it!Now, I'm going to need a little time to explain this Funghi pizza.  Just a little context for you, I am having an affair with mushrooms at the moment.  Growing up, my mom hated them.  Mushrooms were not called mushrooms in my house; they were called \fungus.\  Not exactly appetizing.  As I got older I reached the point of \ok, I can tolerate them.\  A few years later, that turned into \Eh, their not so bad.\  And within the last six months . . . \Mushrooms?  YES, PLEASE!\With that being said, this Funghi pizza was life changing.  Who knew wild mushrooms, goat cheese (another current love of mine), truffle oil and chives could create a flavor experience that I will never ever forget?!  Someone at The Parlor knew, and for that I am forever grateful!In summary, when it comes to The Parlor, I am a fan.  The meal got better and better with each dish and I am so excited for my next opportunity to make the drive from the tuke and return to The Parlor.  I already know I'm getting the Roast Beet salad and a Funghi pizza.",0zDKIySM,4314

I really wish they would remodel this place and revive it a little bit because the food is really good.  The owner is always around our server has worked there for 33 years if that doesn't tell you something.  The atmosphere in the bar is black and white checkerboard tile with mirrors for walls.

It wasn't bad...it just wasn't great.The table shared a couple of Caprese Salad's...there was one single leaf of basil in the center of the plate.  The tomato's were dark pink (if we can get bright red tomato's in Minneapolis in the winter, why can't they get ripe tomato's in Chandler?).  Again...it was ok, but I expected more.I had a \primevera\ salad that was comprised of mixed greens, apples, orange, and grapefruit with a creamy raspberry dressing, but it was saturated in blue cheese crumbles that completely overtook the salad.  My entree was a broiled halibut and came with a generous portion of mixed vegetables that were overcooked.  The halibut was simple and tasty, but it was also tiny - probably the smallest portion of halibut I've ever been served.I had a nice glass of Pinot Noir; the only one they served by the glass on the menu.So, all in all...it was ok.

Well, they had a different spin on them and I wanted to try something crunchy.  The flavors were absolutely wonderful in my nachos; the hummus, feta, and tomato were fresh and tasty.  The only knock I would give them is that the chips tasted a bit stale.  In fact, they should probably use pita chips instead of tortilla chips.The bottom line:Good prices, great food ... just pick up some Stacey's Pita Chips from Costco and put 'em in the nachos.

We purchased a sofa that was 25% off.  Great deal.  It's super comfortable and looks awesome in our living room.  Rich chocolate brown.  Today we purchased the matching chair.  Not cheap at $795.00 but it was also 25% off.   I don't know how well the furniture will hold up since we just bought them but they seem to be well made.

781,2.5,"I just got done eating dinner there, and I had to hurry to my computer and write a review. What a cool neighborhood bar kinda place -- with pool -- and food! Good food, at that. Well, I can only vouch for the burgers and fries.There is LOTS of wood panelling in there, and portraits of some old white guys, and neon beer signs aplenty. The interior consists of plain booths, grey linoleum floors, and a nice worn-in bar. It's divided into two rooms. I didn't go into the second, but I could here the satisfying clink of billiard balls emanating from it.The crowd seemed full of regulars. The bartender and other patrons often shouted hellos and goodbyes to people coming in and going out. But they were not unfriendly or cliquish.When we sat down, we found one laminated menu our booth. So hopefully your dining companion is a fast reader.  Luckily, it's fairly short. It's basically burgers, and a few other things you can serve on a bun, fried and fresh sides, and drinks. If you are a beer snob, this place is not for you. In addition to Coors and the like, you can also get some \old school\ specials, such as PBR, Schlitz, and Miller High Life (at a mere $2 a pop!). I am happy to say that they have expanded their selection since they posted their menu online. The wine list now includes actual wines.We ordered a couple of cheeseburgers, the \pounder\ of beer-battered fries, and some sodas. After receiving our drinks, we could hear the lovely sizzle of the flat top grill. Our burgers came out a few minutes later.Though served on a too-small plate, those burgers looked mighty fine. For some reason (maybe because I'm female?) only mine was cut in half. We also got a plastic beer pitcher filled with fries.My burger had a nice crisp outside, and was medium rare inside. They hadn't asked how we wanted them cooked. Good thing I like medium rare. It was topped with actual cheddar cheese, a lot of onions, lettuce and tomato, and was served on a light but durable bun. I think it may have been some kind of egg bread. The meat itself was juicy, and full of flavor. Surprisingly, it didn't have an actual winey flavor. Apparently they use sangria. It lent flavor, but didn't distract.It didn't take long for us to kill our burgers and a pound of fries. When the bill came, it totalled just over $20. What a steal!",lFaGK8uh,1095

And hiking any of the mountains....and the crisp air around Christmastime....and the Westward Ho...but now....Metrocenter is dying, Town & Country is fading (RIP Jutenhoops), girls wear Ugz in June, Cine Capri has been gone for years, the sprawling shopping complexes of Tempe are a nightmare, the State Fair is like attending a live taping of \COPS\, the Two Hippies franchise is spreading faster than an STD in the Rennaissance Faire employee tents, the Marshalls on 18th and Camleback is always messy, McDowell still becomes a parking lot from 4-6pm, the demise of Katz deli is cheered by Scottsdale trust fund babies, downtown is a graveyard - even with big sculptures that look like un-used condoms, Brophy costs $15K a year, the Roosevelt district is barer than ever, people think pajama bottoms and fuzzy slippers are appropriate \going shopping\ attire, everyone is on their phones while driving, your police force is fueled by ticket quotas and small-town entitlement, Lisa G's closed, there are \big brother\ cameras littering the freeways, and it's still just too hot here in the summer. You're asking a lot.What i'm saying, Phoenix, is.....well...I don't think we're long-term material. It's not you. It's me.",wQ74n6xB,1807
785,1.5,"I have to say that the rooms are just fine.  Beds are comfortable, rooms are roomy, ac works, etc.  Here's the deal with this hotel: most rooms share a door with the room next door; something not too comfortable for a female solo traveler.  Plus you can hear EVERYTHING.  First morning, I woke up with my eighbor\ blasting music at 7:00am.  He actually had his side of the door open (scary!).  I asked to be moved, and was told that someone would bring me a new key.  One hour later, no key.  I go to the lobby, and instead of apologizing, front desk lady kept telling me that it wasn't her fault.  I got changed to another room, and my new neighbors decided to have some girl talk until 2:00am.  It was not their fault I could hear them, since they were just talking, but I could tell you the entire conversation, which I heard from my bed.  I was not even trying to listen. Had to go to the front desk 3 times during my stay because the key would stop working.  This would be a nice hotel, but service is lacking, and good luck with taking care of the noise issue.  Really convenient to the convention center, if you can sleep like a log, go for it.",HnHVVrit,3014
786,4.8,Ranch market is one of the best authentic Mexican places in Phoenix. I love there refried beans. I usually get the grilled chicken with rice and beans meal. Very delicious! My fiancee gets the carnitas meal and the meat is cooked perfect. They have many different flavors of horchata and there is always a line for there fresh corn tortillas. Every meal comes with warm corn tortillas and they are really what make the meal. I would recommend just about everything except I think Food City has better pan dulces.,ItLOG1gG,2474
787,3,i went here this past Saturday and the place was packed. I went to the bartender to get some drinks and ordered some jello shots (15) to be exact. The bartender starts handing them to me and I asked if someone could take them to the patio for us. He belligerently said he wouldn't and passed me off to an even ruder server who totally rolled her eyes!! Too bad b/c me and my crew love to drink......and tip well. Don't these people work for tips. But I guess I forget it was Mill and most  of them are probably college students - good luck paying for it! HA!,8VmwaEb3,2014

By the looks of the parking lot and people, I thought, \Wow this place must be awesome.\  Despite the large crowd, we were seated right away since there were only two of us.  We both had burgers and personally I wasn't that impressed.  The best part about this whole place is the outside look/feel.  It does look very neat.  But the inside is kind of junky (Covered in $1 bills) and the food was below average in my  opinion.  I think next time I will eat lunch elsewhere on my way through Apache Trail.  Maybe just stop here for the ice cream.  Not even to use the bathroom- I heard the girls bathroom stalls are only half-stalls.",wmhqteup,1412

My husband had been nagging me to try this little place, but we are late dinner people when we're out, so the \earlier than most restaurant closing hours\ didn't mesh with our schedule for a few weeks. It was worth the hassle to coordinate!! The Dirty Rice was incredible, and may just be my new favorite order out comfort food. We also had fried oyster Po' Boys, and oh my heck, they were THE most incredible sandwiches EVER. Give this tiny lil place a try, family and locally owned!!!!",4bnNo9WC,2141

We're the only ones in the place aside from the staff.  We probably would've left had it not been for the \People Love Us On Yelp\ sticker on the door and Alfred, the friendly owner who was also our waiter...Jared not only agreed to go somewhere new but he allowed me to do the ordering.  The first dish that caught my eye was some sort of vegetarian dish that Alfred said people either love it or hate it.  He wasn't trying too hard to sell it, so we went with some more common (at least to us) choices from the menu:  spring rolls (the kind that are not fried) with chicken, a noodle dish similar to a pad seu eu, and a vegetable dish with tofu that we added okra to.  (I love okra!)Unfortunately, the chicken in the spring rolls was rubbery and kind of gross... and the vegetable dish was covered in a really oily sauce that lacked flavor.  I'd probably give this place two stars, but Alfred was nice enough and they serve okra - huge props for that.  Even so, the meal was pricey for what we had... and I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon.  I hope it was an off night for their sake.  And now, because of our so-so / not fantastic experience, I am pretty sure I will not be allowed to choose the date night restaurant for a while... :(",OYCC8y4p,3829

Some college basketball game was on tv. As we enjoyed our beers and caught up on life, my friend laughed and said, \This place seems to be popular with aging frat boys.\ I asked him what made him say that, and he pointed to some guy sitting across the bar from us.

It's one of the few coffee house environments in the area between Central Ave  and the Biltmore Plaza at 32nd Street & Camelback RD. I have stopped in twice and it's always busy. The cookies and bread I have tasted here is very good and fresh. However I have made purchases from the Paradise Bakery in the food court at Paradise Valley Mall and the brownie was so had I had to return it.  I was refunded my money and given mircowaved blueberry muffin that was probably heated to hide that it was not fresh.It's all on the pricey side for simple baked goods coffee drinks and sandwiches so I have yet to make this a place I go to regularly.,0inhuT0Q,751

805,1.8,Yikes!  This place was not what I expected after reviewing the previous Yelps.  My mom and I went there for the lunch buffet for $9.99.  Perhaps that was the mistake?  The buffet runs until 2:00 and we arrived around 1:00.  We should have turned around and left immediately when we noted only four people in the entire restaurant.  The food on the line was obviously the same stuff they put out at 11am.  The pad thai was forgettable which is what I had my mouth set on and the chicken panang had no chicken that I could find.  The wonton salad was good except for the limp,1Kqla8F6,2185

811,3.4,"I'm really hoping it was just an off night, but somehow, I doubt it. The service was horrible. We asked for sweetener with our iced tea, and the server forgot to bring it. We didn't get the sweetener until we asked her again when she delivered our appetizer sampler. The appetizer was nothing special: french fries, fried shrimp, fried catfish, fried oysters, jalapeno poppers, and hushpuppies. Everything was just ok, except for the inedibly slimy, weird-tasting oysters. Those were gross. Their \remoulade\ sauce just tasted like straight-up horseradish and mayo. Not good. On to the entrees... We waited about 45 minutes for our entrees after we were served our appetizer. My partner ordered the Baby Kay's combo of red beans and rice and chicken and andouille sausage gumbo. Her beans and rice were ok, but the gumbo was pretty bland and lukewarm. When the server delivered the food, she said she'd be right back with the garlic bread that was supposed to come with the combo, but she never came back. I ordered the half catfish po'boy and cup of seafood gumbo. My gumbo was cold and really bland. I really thought they'd at least get the gumbo right. The po'boy wasn't anything special. It was really dry and flavorless. If our server had checked on us, we'd have complained about the cold gumbo, but she didn't even return with the garlic bread she promised. We even had to ask the busser for our check. Overall, bad service and bland food. Cajun food is supposed to have tons of flavor, but we didn't find that in anything we ordered. We definitely won't be back. It was not worth the time or money.",HwjCqN4X,1369

Worse was the watery, flavourless hummus.Less important, but still off-putting, were the cheap paper plates and the tacky hand-written sign next to the soda fountain insisting \Only 1 refill\.\Bland\ sums up our experience.",6YkCmoU6,1999

That said - this place goes though more re-decorating than any other mall in the valley!  And we're not just talking about a fabric/color kind of upgrade. The food court alone has had massive structural changes at least 8 times.  So though I visited just months ago, who knows what might have changed by the time you read this because I hear they are about to start some changes again.  As always, newer \hotter\ new stores will be joining the ranks.  They never let themselves fall TOO far behind.  PV Mall does a great job of balancing higher and lower end shops to ensure there's a little something for everyone.  From Disney Store to Fredrick's, Industrial RideShop to The Knife Shop and long time favorite The Hobby Bench, they make sure to get in all types of interests as well.  They do a great job of being a real neighborhood mall. Sure, we know where to go if we want some fancy or super specialized store, but for our basic mall eeds\ - we always come here first. Side note - You'd think there is something in the water.  There are always tons of baby carts - especially morning/afternoon.  It's like the stay at home mom hang out!

825,3.9,"I can't think of anything I would rather do than eat out--sorry husband, I'm an eater, not a lover.  Thus, I was deeply saddened that we made the mistake of choosing to eat here after running an errand at the mall.We arrived during linner (in between lunch and dinner) so not very busy at all.  Yet, it was still 10 minutes to even get our drink order taken.  Just as we were about to leave, our sorry excuse for a server shows up.  We were very curt, not rude, with her so she must have got the point.She now overcompensates by trying to be our BFF.  It's clear where she was at during our arrival--running her mouth to anyone who would listen.  My husband ordered a dragon roll (he said it was just okay) and she proceeds to quiz him about why he likes it because she's never tried it, and further explains she has always wanted to ask her customers that but is usually too busy.  Now the dumb ass had admitted she's not busy.  He also orders miso soup as an appetizer.  Less than five minutes into the dragon roll, his entree arrives.  No soup.  The server comes by and asks \did you ever get your soup?\  Yes, he ate it and the empty bowl it was so good.  She generously took the non-existent soup off our bill-no apology.I had the macadamia nut chicken, and the server made sure to tell me what a good choice I made because that is their signature dish.  For a signature dish, it was just okay.  Chicken done nicely, but could have used a little more of the chutney.  My husband had the seared ahi (which was a little more than seared, slightly overcooked) with a sweet chili sauce that looked like either a blind person plated it or the server tripped because sauce was spilled over one side of the plate.Server again disappeared in between my husband's plate being removed and my finishing.  I suggested we tip $4.19 so she can buy a gallon of gas to look for a new job, but we opted on a 10% tip as we have had worse.  Unlikely I will return however.",A0fUwYa2,566

827,1,"I have to say it is refreshing to get another brunch place in the area besides Kashman's.  I have eaten there twice and have gotten the same thing.  I strongly recommend the \Gobble Gobble\ wrap. The turkey was fresh inside along with yummy stuffing and cranberry sauce.  If you miss that Thanksgiving meal, it is a great choice. My husband ordered the turkey burger along with sweet potato fries. We thoroughly enjoyed the sweet potato fries, but he enjoyed my wrap better than his turkey burger.  My father in law got the lox, bagel, and cream cheese and said the lox was very fresh tasting.  My mother in law got eggs along with a side of fruit. The fruit included strawberries, blueberries, and bananas which looked very fresh and a great combo rather than most places that just have mixed melon for their sides of fruit.  The items are not overpriced on the menu either.  I hear they are open for dinner now, but I have not seen the dinner menu yet. Lastly, everyone I have gone with has commented on the ambiance of the restaurant looking very clean and comfortable.  If you just want a casual breakfast or lunch in the area, go try out Harvest.",dnyo9Bct,4907

This store is like a chef's dream. At least an amateur cook who likes to call herself a chef (me!). I walk in and I see easels, I see pop corn machines, I see professional knife sets, I set freezers, I see chef supplies...there's so much to look at it's almost over whelming! I know this is a store for restaurants, but is it a crime for little old me to shop there too because I want to! Every time I've visited Andrews, they've always had what I was looking for. The tools at this place make me want to cook twice as much as I already do! In addition to amazing restaurant supplies,  the staff is very friendly and I learned that Andrews is the only locally owned restaurant supply store in Phoenix. And you know how we on yelp love to support local! So regardless of the drive, Andrews has made a customer out of me.

If I every return it will be only for the shrimp cocktails and salsa and chips.  $50+ total for dinner (one shrimp cocktail, 2 taco dinners and 3 margaritas).

Not sure if this helps but stick with the soup.  Get the double size.  The springs rolls are pretty good too.  Do not get the sandwich unless you are in the mood for something small.  The portions are not very big here but the food is big on flavor.  The service here is not that great though pretty slow.  If you are in a crunch for lunch I would not recommend unless you order over the phone and pick up.  The prices are pretty decent.

They have a few couches that are mostly used for table reservations, and a decent number of chairs and smaller tables scattered throughout the place (on a busy night, it might be a little hard to find seating).Whether you're looking for the perfect way to kick off or cap an evening out, it's a pretty safe bet that Kazimierz will be what you are looking for.

Their ingredients are extremely fresh and their dishes are beautifully plated for a casual cafe. We tried the pesto presto sandwich, which consisted of avocado, sunflower sprouts, tomato slices and pesto on a whole wheat baguette. They give such a generous amount of avocado it is SO good, and the pesto flavor is perfect and not too over-powering. The tortilla soup was the best I've tried yet. We also had the BLT on whole wheat toast. They use tempeh bacon and it was delish! We also tried the \donut holes\ - if you check-in on foursquare (1st time only) you get a free donut hole.  Well, they were definitely not the donut hole I was expecting - basically a ball of organic raw type ingredients...of what I'm not sure but the two flavors they had resembled the taste of a Lara Bar - just in a ball. :)Only downside is that it is a little pricier for their sandwiches/ lunch. But definitely worth it!",cpABfYyy,2384
842,3.2,Fantastic experience from valet to dessert!! Boyfriend and I were both very impressed. We were graciously greeted the moment we walked in by a man in a suit who walked us to the restaurant. Our server was knowledgeable about all the items on the menu and suggested some things to try when we were waffling between a few different choices. Cheese trio platter was sooooo good. I'll be getting that every time we come here and it was the perfect size for the two of us to share. I had the beet salad which was very good. Love the candied walnuts in it. Boyfriend had the lamb which he said was perfect: Tender,ksckEqpz,680

847,4.2,We came here for drinks the inside was spacious with a mechanical bull people were having a great time with that.  The outside patio was nice with the fire going.  The setting was ranch and country-ish but the music was pretty much anything mostly top 40 but the dj was willing to play whatever you request.  I think the DJ was the star of the night he had great music and didn't hang out behind his turntables all night he was having fun with the crowd and engaging people in a good time.,MxVI1I4U,194
848,3.4,"Ranch Market is like a fiesta ALL THE TIME!  I love this place.  The deli offers tasty \truly authentic\ dishes that you can either eat there or take home.  Sometimes on my way home from work I will get the carnitas dinner for 2-3 people, and it literally feeds my boyfriend and I for a couple days.  For less than $10 you get a healthy bag of freshly cooked carnitas, homemade tortillas, salsa, beans and rice.  I usually buy a big bag of Michael's chips (they are saltier than Rick's) and a 1/2 pint of pico de gallo to take with me as well.  I am always impressed with the produce at Ranchie (that is what I call it for short).  I love using key limes for margaritas at home, but they can get pricey...not at Ranchie!  I am the envy of all of my out-of-state friends.  Any time they come to the desert for a visit, I take them there!",rrCA9378,4385
849,2.4,"First time back to Serrano's in several years.  Not a good experience...food took about 40 minutes...one person in our group could not eat it because of too much spice.  Server told us that the slow service was because they only have a small grill in the kitchen and one of our group (me) ordered a plate with a chicken breast which takes extra time.  Finally, the \credit card system\ was down.  Overall, food was just okay...Nando's is a much better choice in my opinion.  I think it may be a couple more years before we return to Serrano's if at all.",SOwyoQf3,3866

851,1.2,"There's something magical about this place. The entrance is tucked away from the street and there are no big, lit up, neon signs hanging from the store front. All you see, is a little saying that reads \The Truth is Inside\. It kind of reminds me of the entrance to a Disney ride, which always excites me. The ambiance is great. It's like a little den that's lit with candles. The seating isn't conventional, but close to the ground and comfortable, it gives you a sense of relaxation, a perfect recipe for conversation. The servings are quite large and we over ordered as we always do. Even though we were stuffed to brim we made room for dessert. Bittersweet Chocolate Fondue - with house made marshmallows and peanut butter cookie dough?!? What??? Wow, is all I can muster up. I can't think of anything better. It's like a recipe to my heart. Yes, I may have fallen in love that night.",v27KwTfR,2311

853,2.9,"We didn't have a good experience here.   My husband was given a gift certificate for a one hour massage.   I decided to join him and we booked a couples massage.    We got to the resort a little early and hung out at the pool while we waited for our massage.   I then looked around the spa area and was given a brief tour of the area by an attendant.   While I was on my tour I overheard a man say to another man \do you want my 1:30.\    I didn't really pay that much attention until they came to get us for our massage.   My husband got a woman and I had the man that was trying to give away the 1:30 appointment which happened to be ME!     Things kind of  went downhill from there.   We were escorted into the couples room for our massage.   I wasn't asked if I wanted any special oils or lotions.  I wasn't asked if I wanted a certain part of my body done or if I was having trouble spots.   Then while doing my massage he didn't do the back upper part of my legs, I had to tell him to do that.    Most of the massages you have the masseuse does your whole body without being told what to do.   I just feel like it was a burden for this man to do the massage. For the prices they charge and the \so-called\ reputation they have I expected better.   I don't remember his name but the person my husband had was Jeanie (I think).  She has been there about 15 years and she was excellent.   She did an excellent job on my husband and didn't have to be told what to do.   My husband stated she did parts of his neck that he wasn't even aware he had muscles.    There are better places for less money.   I didn't think the spa rooms were that great either.    Also, they didn't give you any pre-spa services such as the heated neck pad while you wait for your massage.",Og8N1k7f,1003

855,2.1,"My first Ethiopian experience in AZ.  Jared's first Ethiopian experience ever!  Friday night - no food in the house - I throw around ideas of places to go, Jared nixes them... this is how the evening started.  But somehow I convinced him to get in the car and head towards Tempe.  I knew there were some Ethiopian joints, and I somehow convinced him to try Lalibela!  We both really enjoyed it!Mona was our waitress... and she suggested we share the #16 (Meat Combination) and #17 (Vegetable Combination) to give us a variety of dishes.  That would've been plenty, but I also wanted to try the #10 (Shiro Wat / Ground Peas), so we had that too... oh and since Jared was starving, he ordered a Shorba (Lentil Soup) to start.  The soup was just ok, but the food was delicious!  We loved the injera (Ethiopian Bread).  and used it to eat the variety of dishes served on a big platter.  Our favorites were the Gomen (collard greens), Fosolia (string beans and carrots), and Key Sega Wat (spicy beef stew), but literally everything was good... we were stuffed after almost cleaning the platter!I have some friends that have more adventurous palates (ahem, Colleen C), so I look forward to sharing more Ethiopian meals with them at Lalibela in the future!And one last thing:  for anyone questioning Ethiopian eating etiquette, it says on the front of the menu that \traditional Ethiopian etiquette disapproves of licking fingers while eating (even though it may be tempting to do so).  I hope that anyone that shares future meals with me at Cafe Lalibela will adhere to this too.",L5xmpDrT,1617
856,2.1,"There are so few restaurants that deserve a 5-star rating, but Razz is undoubtedly one of them.  While the exterior of the building appears nondescript, the interior is tastefully decorated and replete with artwork hanging on the walls.  We always make a reservation to sit at the chef's table and everything we've ever had has been phenomenal.  My husband and I have very diverse tastes and are willing to try just about anything, but I can honestly say that beef tongue is probably not something that we would ever have ventured to taste had it not been served to us here.  It's now one of our favorite dishes, as is the \macaroni and cheese\ with lobster and crab meat. The wine selection is great as well and we typically ask Razz to recommend a bottle and have never been disappointed.  It's so clear that Razz is an incredibly talented chef who is doing what he loves to do!  The restaurant does close over the summer so we will be eagerly awaiting its reopening in the fall to try some more of Razz's amazing creations.",68rzc8U1,3087

They do not have a gluten free menu available, but they will work with you to get you something you'll enjoy.  I ordered the pan roasted chicken.  It was served with awesome mashed potatoes, mashed sweet potatoes and fresh carrots, broccoli and snap peas.  GREAT dinner!!!  We were served by Josh, and he was very friendly and accommodating.  GREAT service also!!!

But LGO crosses the line from \yea, this is pretty slow but let's just chill and enjoy ourselves\ to \Where the f*** is my beer?\ and later \where the f*** is the check.\The folks at LGO all know they work at a hot little spot that people will come to because the product is good. Every time I go, they've been rude and genuinely disinterested in serving me (I've been to the grocery twice, and the pizzeria once). Pizza was very good, but next time I'll stick with Pizza Heaven where they treat me like a customer. You know, someone who gives you money for the goods and services you provide.

They give you a choice of cheese for your omelet--I thought that was pretty uptown for a diner! :-) The owner says he tries to source as much locally as he can which is also nice---support your local Farm Bureau!

872,4.6,Our group of 4 adults went on the afternoon of Mar 17.  We were somewhat apprehensive about what was there.  The material online suggested that it might be very slanted to children and there was very little in the usual tourist marketing.  It is located on the groungs of a school.  Parking is not a problem and free!  The staff appears to be mainly volunteer.There are tours every hour and our guide was outstanding.  We were very impressed with the displays and the interaction  with the guide. Although there is a slant toward children there is more that enough for adults.

873,3.4,"This is not \fast\ food.  This is \at their pace\ food.  It took forever to get someone's attention to order, then the food took *longer* than what it takes at a full-service restaurant, and then it was a chore to pay and leave.  Other patrons were getting impatient as well with the staff, just meandering around, taking their sweet time to ring someone up while a line formed with people buying Pepsi & other items.  Really, really frustrating.Older building too, not so nice inside with decor.  Like eating inside a Seven-Eleven with less lighting.Food was just alright, but perhaps above average for Phoenix standards because Indian cuisine in Phoenix doesn't compare well to most major metros.  Portions were generous.  Prices were pretty much the same as a full service restaurant.  Food served on either styrofoam plates or metal TV-dinner tray.",m8WJD6VW,1036

But let's talk about the purple and teal accent colors that scream \I was remodeled in the 80's\! Lame.Good chips and salsa but small-ass bowls!

We started with the Food and Wine, top 10 dishes of the year, braised leeks with housemade mozzarella and an egg. It was good. But, I was just as happy with the fresh bread and (so good that it's) green, flavorful EVOO.We had the Halibut, Broccoli and a special of prawns. The broccoli was something worth writing home about. I'm going to try to duplicate at home. As the girl next to me at the counter said, \it's the best broccoli you've ever had times 100.\ The Halibut was lovely. Cooked perfectly, lightly seasoned and served under a salad featuring kumquats from the chef's neighbor's garden. That's local!One of the more interesting, engaging dining experiences that I've had in a long, long time. Reserve a seat at the FnB counter immediately, if you like fresh, inventive, local, in season food with impeccable presentation. *Except for the Gastropub part, the food is too light, fresh and the setting more intimate than a gpub.",6gU3vD6i,3227

881,3.4,"We rolled up to the state fair on a fine Sunday afternoon.  I was well hydrated and ready for an evening of debauchery involving barnyard animals, deep fried GARBAGE, shitty domestic beer in a plastic cup, and \amusement\ rides.  Zed and Nickels were on the buddy system, I was their backup buddy, the third wheel on the tricycle of fun, 3-dub for short.Is it sad that the best thing I can say about the State Fair is that with enough beer it becomes tolerable?  I discovered that I am not a big fan of deep fried sweets.  Maybe I'm just not in the right space for it, but most of the food options at the Fair looked uniformly gross.  Nickels went gaga over the bunny rabbits while I had a staring contest with a turkey.  Man turkeys are a lot of ugly to pack into one bird.  I'm not sure I can continue to eat something that ugly, because if you are what you eat, well let's just say it's not going to be pretty and leave it at that.You would think the funhouse type attractions would be more fun with a few beers but honestly they just weren't. I wanted them to be, but there was nothing scary or really all that interesting about them.  The sky rail thing was a little fun altough I felt a little silly sitting up there without skis on and you can imagine my disappointment when the ride did not end at the top of a mountain.We successfully avoided a Doughtry concert, which made me happy, but there was some sort of frightening pre-teen dance troup trainwreck that we ended up in front of at some point.  We tried to make light of it.  I tried to remember the hilarity of Donnie Darko's little sister's dance troup.  I made a half hearted attempt at telling Zed that sometimes I doubt his commitment to Sparklemotion but it was no use.  Nickels brought up the fact that somewhere in the audience there was probably a pedophile or two taking in the show and it was all down hill from there.  We walked away skeeved out at a society that thinks it's cute to paint up 11 year olds like $10 whores, throw them in sparkly boyshorts, teach them to shake their asses in some semblance of coordinated effort and call it entertainment.",GURtX3yx,4837

Meat - heck no.  Here's the thing - it's the closest grocery store to me in many ways (If you don't count the Super Wal-Mart, and I don't) and I really wanted to like it, but it just kinda freaked me out too much the first time to trust it again. After going into Ranch Market I figured this would be about the same.  I was SO wrong.  The produce section had flies all over it and many of the items were well past their naturally intended expiration date.  And once you got half way over - the smell of the Carniceria was SO strong and rancid I almost tossed my cookies right there.  This was about... oh... 8-9 months ago.Last week I ran in because \someone\ at home wanted a bag of Doritos and some sour cream.  It was a block from where I was, and both of those products would be pre-packaged so I figured I'd give it a shot.   I could tell that they had made some improvements, and their produce and meat sections looked much better, but I'm not willing to throw those dice just yet.  Personally - I say just go down the street to Ranch Market.  It's right on Southern and such an amazingly different shopping experience.

Once we pulled up we were greeted by some really amazing valet guys, tip well those boys deserve it for running in the AZ heat. While checking in Marni was amazing and put us in a room she would prefer, so we were upgraded and when we walked into our room my husband was like a kid,  he was so shocked at how amazing the room was but we wanted to explore so we went to trader vic's happy hour and met Raven and many other business owners to network with ... It was an absolute blast. I am sorry to say they are going out of business at the end of July but the valley ho will still be incredible..

The service and food were great and so I know I will be back.They seem to have pretty much the same menu as the other locations and the quality of the food was just as good as well.  The restaurant itself is pretty spacious, it looks like the building was formerly a house since there are many rooms instead of one big dining area.  The best part is the large \backyard\ area.  They didn't have all the patio furniture set up yet but I hope they will take advantage of the grassy lawn and put some seating under the shade of the large mature trees.

I can't wait for it too cool down a little more so we can sit outside next time and it looks like a nice spot for happy hour, too.Only problem is the parking, since it is across from Arcadia Farms who has commandeered most of the street parking for their valet service.  But we were able to find plenty of open spots on Main St, just one block south.",ghu84JhE,2359

904,2.3,"I have no idea why this place is called \Pranksters\, but the joke was definitely on me. After being whisked here by an older crowd, I opened the door and thought I was at the wrong place. This could have been an AARP meeting! The vast majority of customers appeared to be senior citizens.But it wasn't uncomfortable at all. I played some pool and had some appetizers. Hot wings were decent, but the mozzarella sticks were questionably soft, probably so their regulars could gum them. The waitress was good, and managed to keep making her rounds even though the place was packed.We jammed out to some covers of 60's music. I was then informed that I had seen only half the bar......the other half looks like a completely different place. You can't really hear the live music, the crowd is much younger, and it looks more like a sports bar than a music venue. Why the larger side wasn't used for the venue is a mystery, but I guess having two bars in one makes for interesting times. Just not interesting enough for me to go out of the way. If you get stuck in Scottsdale, do check it out though. It was cheap!",OQSaKGLe,1843
905,4.8,"Unfortunately, I will not be going back to this place. I was just in there earlier and noticed a few unsanitary things about this place. The only reason I gave them 2 stars was because the coffee tasted good despite it having contaminated ice (hope I don't get sick). So this is what happened for those curious:I walked in and sat down. The girl working, who looked extremely hungover, did not greet me or say any word to me as i looked at the menu. She just stood there until I asked for something. I ordered a coffee and a crepe. While she was making my coffee, she scooped the ice out of a dingy looking ice container and just dropped the scoop back in. She did this multiple times while I was there. The germs from her hand  were all over the ice and in everyone's drinks...Then, she kept wiping down all the counters with the SAME dirty rag over and over again. And after she got done \wiping\ (or spreading everything) on the counter, a guy that was working, not sure if it was the owner or not, decides to start making some drinks for people after being outside, without washing his hands. He picked up a clean spoon to mix in caramel in some coffee and threw the spoon down on the counter right in front of me. Then, when he was making another drink, he picked up the SAME spoon from the dirty counter and used it to mix someone else's drink. He was very sloppy making the drinks, which doesn't bother me until you get unsanitary with it. I am very concerned nothing is cleaned properly just by their behavior, including the bucket of ice the girl brought in to refill the ice container. I am sure this place isn't the only one that does this stuff but having it happen all in front of you is a whole other experience.I was not able to really enjoy my crepe because I was too focused on all this going down, so I will not write a review on the food. I feel sick to my stomach.",lWpdc8w9,658
906,1.4,"Looked good from far, but far from good!  Dined there jan.3 for dinner&  it was our first time.  We walked in and stood at the hostess station for about 4 minutes with no acknowledgment.  Finally I asked the girl if we needed to put our names in for seating.  After not getting seated for about 10 minutes (out of order), we started browsing the buffet.  There is quite a variety of different dishes that you wouldn't see at a normal chinese buffet.  By the time you had to narrow your choices from either dry, or burnt, rubbery entrees, we settled on the safer choices.  The waiter didn't show up to take our drink order for about 5 minutes.  We didn't actually get our hot tea until we were finished with our first plates.  The tea wasn't even jasmine tea!  It was a lipton tea bag!    He never checked on us or even picked up one single plate throughout our entire meal.  I asked him how long they had been open, he said since october.  Now tell me how a restaurant that is only 3 months old can have the worst hostesses, wait staff, & cooks imaginable.  I had mentioned to the waitor how unacceptable everything was...  he apologized and then took another 30 minutes to give us the bill.  The price for an adult was 15.99 and my 4 yr. Old was charged $3.88. Plus the two bucks for the bitter lipton tea.  There was no attempt to get a manager to rectify the situation.  Clearly, nobody cares what you think.  I was so infuriated that a lack of management presence allows these\ teenagers\ and their lackidaisical attitudes run this place.  So i'm yelping!   Mediocre food, high prices, and crappy service.  Will never go back again, unless they pull their act together and start getting better reviews.",ykQr0jlF,1838
907,4.9,"After several hundred professional massages over the past 20 years, I encountered today a first -- a massage therapist who explained that she could not do a massage involving any but mild pressure using her hands. It was an issue of \protecting the thumbs.\ When I told her I didn't like forearms and elbows, she explained that she'd never worked without using her forearms (and, I assume, her elbows, too). After just five minutes, when I asked for more pressure, she suggested we stop the massage -- that she wasn't the \therapist for [me].\ She was right. What are they teaching these people these days, and why doesn't an excellent outfit like LifeTime Fitness insist on better skills among its massage staff? I won't offer her name, but, if considering a massage at this establishment, I suggest Casie as the only therapist here worth the money.",WqCPOW5B,4426
908,3.1,"This place is awesome!  Friend told me about it so I went and the lady knew I was a first timer so she walked me thru everything and then even helped me put a special sauce combo together. Then ate that up, she handed me my seven dollar bill and said, \It all you can eat go right ahead.\ Never have those words sounded so good.They have watercress, pineapple and several other vegetable selections.  Tofu is an extra $1.50 but they throw in the whole carton.  of course regular meats(Pork, Chicken, Beef, Turkey).  Then they have three different kinds of noodles that go from thick to really tiny. and then plethora of sauces to choose from. Also they have fried items and fried rice down to the left back of the restaurant.I highly recommend giving it a try. I'm going back tomorrow!",BeMGGSna,270

That day I only met with a nurse (pregnancy test, and basic information) but I left feeling 100% confident in the care I would receive. Since then every experience from the front desk, the ultrasound tech, Sandra (the NP) and Dr. Newman, and I have never left that office without feeling taken care of and educated. Their on staff lab technician is wonderful as well and always finds a vein while other struggle and bruise me. I know the office has gone through the process of loosing 2 doctors, but you would never be able to tell.  Another highlight is the online patient portal where I have access to lab results and the option to email a nurse to ask questions. I have always receive responses within 24hrs and recently even got a phone call in return because :I could tell you needed to hear a voice from all of your questions.\I really cannot say enough good things- for the first time in a long time my experiences with a Dr.'s office has not ended with long wait times, insurance confusions, and that rushed over feeling with unanswered questions.

917,1.6,Wunderbar!This is easily one of my favorite restaurants in metro Phoenix.  I've been there 3 times now and have loved each visit.  On two of the visits I sat at the patio area.  On both nights it was chilly but they keep propane heaters going that really warm the place up (you might not want to sit too close to them as they give off a lot of heat) the other time I sat at the bar watched a game whilst drinking German beer and eating a giant Bavarian pretzel.Haus Murphy's has great atmosphere and darn good food.  The above mentioned pretzel is a must and goes great with the German mustard.  Their mustard has a great kick and will clear any nasal passage.  As far as the entrees I have had the sauerbraten and the schweinebraten and enjoyed both.The German beer selection tops anything I've seen in Phoenix thus far.  I recommend the Konig Ludwig Hefeweizen.Service was great every visit.  Kudos to the manager who dealt with a fussy customer at the table across from mine during my last visit.  She took it all in stride and didn't let if phase her one bit.  Very professional even when being wronged.I can't praise them enough.  I'd give them 5 stars but I've been to a German restaurant elsewhere that was better (no fault to Haus Murphy's,zngkEY0O,2179

(Los Bicicletas De Muerte) Mustache Ride yesterday.Thankfully Lauren V. had posted local costume places. I had no debit card or credit card, two bucks in assorted change, and 25 minutes to get a stache. I felt like I was in some kind of lame Tempe Mustache Race against Time- and Lauren V. saved my ass...well, actually my FACE.Located probably a whopping two blocks away from me, I was surprised to see Arizona Fun Services (it totally sounds like an Escort Service, I know) was NOT in a strip mall. But the parking lot was rubber tire burning turnable, and I raced inside, finding a helpful hip younger lady: \Where are your mustaches!!!\ She showed me a display case of all kinds of lovely staches, starting from 9 bucks, and talked about the spirit gum and adhesive remover kit. But she pointed for my drunken pedaling purposes the wall near the dressing rooms would prove adequate.And indeed they were. I settled on a lovely curley number for a buck and some change (it hurt like fuck later, but damn it did the job) and was out the door in under ten minutes.Thank you Lauren and Thank YOU AZ Fun Services!",4Xmjr3Fi,2013
921,2,I've been trolling all the Mexican reviews lately and have seen many people talk about beef tongue and beef cheek tacos. I got it in my mind that I had to try this somewhere. Search for lengua brought up a few places and this was closest to home.Company always makes a food adventure more fun so I dropped NormR a message and asked if he wanted to grab some lunch.We arrived at 1:30 on a Saturday and the place was empty. This appeared to be a family affair type place and were greeted by who I would assume was a son with a spiked mohawk. I already liked the place but this was a little weird for a Mexican joint.After looking over and menu and doing some guessing as to what things were he came over to take our order I asked him a question about something. He informed me the English version was on the opposite side.. Ahh the DOH moment ;) been having way to many of those lately.This is a really cool little restaurant.

922,3.7,"This is my favorite non-gourmet pizza place in the entire Valley.As a transplant from the Northeast, Joe's satisfies my desire for decent New York-style pizza (and associated items like chicken rolls and garlic knots) in a metropolitan area that is largely devoid of high-quality \by the slice\ pizza joints. I have visited both during the daytime and evening and have always found the service efficient and friendly.If one has experienced less than stellar service at 2 AM, than maybe one should consider why he or she is getting that service. To borrow the lyrics of the New Radicals, \you only get what you give.\ If I had to deal with some of the Scottsdale populace at 2 AM while in a state of exhaustion in a kitchen where the temperature is in excess of 100 degrees, I might be a little cranky too about having to deal with drunk antics.I only wish there was a Joe's closer to downtown Phoenix.

923,2.7,"As stated by the other reviewers, this place is new.  Just opened on Mill not too long ago.  So far, I would say, this place has the best sushi in Tempe (around ASU) and yes, a great happy hour deal (every day 3-7).  However, there are two things on the menu that I would not recommend: the black mussels and the spicy raymen.  The mussels  were bland and did not seem very fresh, which was a disappointment for me because I love mussels.  And the raymen was just ok.  Definitely not as they described it , i.e., \gourmet.\  Almost positive it came from a package.  If you want raymen or ramen in Tempe, go to Republic Ramen + Noodles.  But, all in all, for the balance of price and quality, definitely four stars.",QMWkwCLW,2195

927,3.7,"Okay, time for an update on my ALL TIME FAVORITE place! Let me be completely honest and frank....Goody Twos Toffee is my crack. I don't smoke, seldom drink alcohol, heck....I don't even drink caffeine! But jeez, there is something special about Market Street. **In the interest of full disclosure let me state I freakin' LOVE Donna & Stacey- the owners! Since I spend waaaay too much time (and money) there every week, they have become friends since my last written review**. But then again, how can you not love the two people who make your life easier (and a little sweeter at the same time)? Since my last review I've given Goody Twos Toffee as presents for practically every occasion - Holidays, Birthdays, Thank You Gifts, Teacher Appreciation Gifts, you name it. Whenever there is an event, everyone I know and love gets toffee. YOU can make it totally custom for the person receiving the gift- with colors of boxes, ribbons, their name, or business logo, a message and a sentiment from you. Why do I give toffee as presents for everyone? 2 REASONS: 1) It's completely unique. Nobody else has seen or tasted anything like it, and the custom packaging makes them feel special. 2) EVERYONE loves it and is thrilled. Do you know how hard it is to get presents for people who don't need another damn thing? Or people who you don't know well enough what to get them, but you want to get them something they will enjoy? Taa-Daa....Goody Twos Toffee makes your life easier then. So If you ever need a great gift that is sure to be unique AND appreciated (or you just want something special for yourself), be sure to go to Goody Twos Toffee. Guaranteed, you will agree with my 10 year old daughter who thinks their confections \are made with vitamin L-O-V-E\!  (and kids don't lie!)Enjoy!",RhW9oNtw,4694

Upon entering the showroom, we were greeted by all of the staff who weren't currently working with other patients...and THEN the receptionist greeted us.The exam itself was a typical eye exam. The doctor was, much like the rest of the staff we had met up to that point, extremely polite. Since my wife and I both had appointments at the same time, the doctor was kind enough to allow my daughter to come into the exam room with me. After the exam, my wife and I were faced with the daunting task of picking out frames. To put this mildly, my wife and I are...let's just say that we're \particular\ about our glasses. Colleen was exceptionally patient with each of us, as we sifted through the myriad of frames they had to offer us. Once we finally picked the frames, Colleen was fantastic. She crunched the numbers to determine which option worked the best with our insurance. It's always nice when someone goes out of their way to SAVE you money.Colleen informed us that our glasses would most likely be available within two weeks. Much to our surprise, all three pairs of our glasses (one pair of prescription sunglasses and two regular pairs) were ready in 6 calendar days!Once we came in to pick up our glasses, the fantastic customer service picked up where it left off.To save time, my wife and I each sat with different people to ensure that our glasses were to our liking. My wife sat with Colleen, and I sat with Cami.  As I mentioned before, my wife and I tend to be \particular\ about our glasses. Both Colleen and Cami were exceptionally patient with us, adjusting our respective glasses accordingly to guarantee that our glasses fit JUST right.All in all, my family couldn't be more pleased with the service we received from Riviera Opticare.

I guess I coulda gone all jack- Nicholson- in- Five- Easy- Pieces on their asses, but I didn't.  I was too numbed by the ugliness of the decor and the doo-wop pounding into my morning-after brain. There's a reason almost everyone sits outside. My wife wanted a burger, and our usual Sunday morning breakfast-and-burger place , Chompie's, was flooded with hungover ASU students and people wanting a bite before hitting the Tempe Arts Fest.  So, we decided to try this place.  Great concept, very poor execution.  Service was glacially slow and more than a little inept.  Wife's burger was just \OK\, nothing to get excited about.  I'm not a meat eater, so I decided to try their grilled cheese-- a horrible, horrible mistake.  bread was nicely grilled, but somehow, some way, the cheese was not melted at all.  my add-ons seemed thrown on by an angry blind man, and it seemed to have been off of the grill a good, long time.  the fries were lukewarm and limp.  the onion rings were OK if a bit greasy.  the worst meal I've had in recent memory!

936,2.8,"My Consumers experience and observations: I first went to the Celebrity in 1973 to see Gordon Lightfoot. Over the years I have seen many other concerts there and enjoyed myself.. I have got to say, this venue  has changed considerably and it needs major refurbishing. Also, I have some safety and security concerns. We went to a concert there this past week for Pepe Aguilar ---- and have not been there in about five years. The sound system is inadequate for the acts they are presenting and the seating is very poor.Safety and security issues -  my opinion. At about twenty minutes into his performance - we still had the same group of intoxicated young women standing directly in front of us and would not sit down. Most everyone else had set down in the area.  At first I asked nicely and they started to give us a hard time.  I did raise my voice once because it was so loud. There was no presence of any staff in the area we were in. I walked down and no one was in the entrance area. I went back to my seat ---- and the women started yelling - \See We Set Down\  then the situation escalated a bit with them dropping a few F bombs directed at the both of us ---- and I went down stairs again - and had to get all the way to the bar area before I found a staff member - I told him there is no one from staff in our area or proximity -- he said he would get a manager ----- Went through three different people before a manager showed up - and he took me outside - I had told him what was going on ---- and he said I needed to read the back of the ticket ---- and at a venue people can stand and there is nothing they can do about it  ---- he then said my behavior was scarring him ---- and wanted a police officer to talk to me ----- I told him I was not going to leave my wife alone ----- He would not let me back in until I spoke to an officer. - He did have someone go to the area to make sure nothing happened to her. The officer who showed up did explain they had no control over people standing up. He was very polite.  I asked to have someone from staff go back with me to my seat ---- so the small group would know ---- I was complaining about them --- The staff member  told me there would be someone in the area (they were there for about ten minutes) and one of the staff members apologized to me and apologized about the lack of numbers on the seats ---- that is another issue --- apparently they are painting and the seats or aisles are not numbered - at least in our area. When we first came into the venue ----- I asked someone for assistance and they took me to the seats - then some other patrons tried to kick us out ----- demanding the seats until they finally figured it out they were wrong. Another issue about safety ---- there is no aisle lighting - making it very difficult to get out of the area.Regarding the standing up issue ----- another review here mentions that - the theater  would not let people stand ---- and kicked them out. I guess it depends on the show. I am concerned that there is not enough staff to safely manage a variety of issues including enough people to escort individuals to the correct seats.. Also, I believe the manager - went overboard talking about my behavior - I made no threatening comments or gestures ----- If there was a problem with my behavior - clearly I demonstrated I was trying to resolve a situation by seeking assistance which was difficult to find. That was part of my frustration.. This establishment needs a remodel the facility and make sure there is staff available for guest  assistance.  And --- according to management - there apparently they have no control intoxicated individuals that won't sit down and let others enjoy the show.  Fortunately the young women finally  left us alone ----- but we left early so there was no chance of them harassing us.My recommendation to management for a more rewarding customer experience:1. Have more staff on duty to deal with customer service issues - or manage staff better to have all areas covered. At minimum the venue should have one person covering each seating section at all times to deal with a wide variety of issues. This could eliminate many problems.2. Be more sensitive to customer complaints. Management could have offered relocating customers if there is a problem (if seating is available). We had to sit through the concert worried we would be harassed.3. Install basic aisle lighting for increased safety of the guest.4. The current seating needs to be replaced with more comfortable seats and or more room between the seats in front of a patron ----- If I had not had an aisle seat - I would have had to crunch my legs up against the seat in front of me -- and we know how that would have gone with that group in front of us :).",FFftuZ1h,2008

The flavors were good if not spectacular. I did really enjoy the potatoes as they were a bit more flavorful then normal breakfast potatoes.

948,3.3,"Cool atmosphere but my friends and I were a bit disappointed with the food.  Before I complain though, I will say that the chips and guacamole were excellent.  Their chips are the thick, greasy kind that always tastes so good.  The guacamole \Blanco style\ has cojita cheese in it and really was delicious!  I had the Blanco Chopped Salad (achiote chicken, seasonal fruits, and pepitas) and found it pretty bland and boring.  (The achiote chicken salad at zTejas is much better.)  Others at the table had the cheese crisp with chicken and the green chile pork enchilada with chicken.  The cheese crisp was huge but nothing too exciting -- all the cheese and chicken seemed to be crammed into the middle, so the end pieces were mostly plain tortilla.  The enchilada with chicken was kinda weird -- it had this weird chewy pulled chicken.  We honestly couldn't even figure out if it was chicken or pork.  The service was okay but it seemed like we constantly needed more water.  The glasses were too small and were filled with ice.  I'd probably come back here just for some chips, guac, and a drink.",ytfbqpMQ,895

950,1.7,"I read some other reviews about how this place makes you feel comfortable and the staff being very friendly and having good conversation while getting your cut.  Now I haven't been to a barber in years so I'm not sure if this is the norm or not but here's my experience.  I walk in around 1:30 on a Wednesday there's one guy getting a haircut in there. I walk in a get a hello from  the barber and that's it.  So I sit down and grab a magazine.  There's some morning show on the tv, but given that it was a Wednesday afternoon I let it slide.  The guy getting his hair cut and the barber seemed to know each other well, and were having a good conversation.  A minute later another guy walks in, seemed to be another friend of the two guys and they all start talking.  About 10 min later some guy comes from the back room and asks \who's next\ I got up and said hi, and i got a half hearted hi in return.  Now I had longer hair and as I said hadn't been to a barber in some time, so mostly I has going for a trim and to get it into some sort of style.  The guy asks how short I want it and I told him I wanted it kept fairly long.  He gives me a puzzled look, and then says \so about a inch to a half inch past the ear?\ Sure I tell him.  He begins cutting.  He tries to ask me questions and I try to give him answers but our conversations end up going nowhere and there are long periods of silence throughout the hair cut.  Also, the entire time he is smacking his gum in my ear.  Eventually we get on the topic of fantasy football and stumble through that. Turns out he doesn't know much about football.  I tell him I also have a fantasy basketball team. He doesn't watch basketball.  I try to mention baseball in there just to see if I can get him to bite on something, but it turns out he doesn't know much about that either.  So much for the great conversation, what kind of barber doesn't know anything about sports?As for the hair cut, remember I told him I wanted it left longer, and we agreed on that?  Guess he forgot, because my hair was much shorter than I had planned on it being.  It wasn't a terrible haircut but definitely not what I was hoping for.  At the end of it I get out of the chair and he stares at me a bit before telling me it's $12.  Needless to say I was pretty happy to get out of there. Maybe it was the guy I got, or maybe that's just the way they run things at Ray's, but it was a pretty disappointing experience.  Seemed like he didn't have a clue as to other hair styles, and just went with his standard.  I don't think I'll be going back.",PJ71PwhK,2893

I went at lunch time so it was understandably busy but I wasn't greeted or acknowledged until I was served. I order the vegetarian sandwich. This is where my visit went downhill. This particular location only has one meat/cheese cutter--which means that the meat AND the cheese are sliced on the same machine--which means that even their \vegetarian sandwich\ is going to have meat goo on it. BUMMER. This is a deal breaker for me but because I had already waited so long to be served I didn't have time to go anywhere else to get food. As I was checking out, I was charged for the avocado I asked for on my sandwich even though it states on the menu that it is included. The less-than-helpful cashier argued with me about it and at the end, I still ended up getting charged. Absolutely, positively will not be returning to this location.",gaXvOgOh,120

Then this other guy comes out takes my keys and says it will be 45 minutes for the four wheel alignment. Fine. So I go across the street for a lunch. 50 minutes pass so I walk back to the car place. The guy sees me coming, quickly moves another car off the.ramp and then moves mine up to work on it. I ask him, \Seriously!! You haven't started it yet??!!?\ He says the other car was here first and its been here all day on the ramp. Except when I dropped off my car the ramp was empty. So fifteen minutes after I came back the car is done. Then I had to take it somewhere else to have the alignment checked again because I didn't trust the guy. Basically this place was more hassle then its worth and the guy was a liar which just isn't a good thing for a mechanic. I will say, that I ended up getting a call later from the manager, and he said he would look into it. Hopefully they're getting their act together, and they fired that guy.

The hostess called us around the 30-minute mark, only to tell us that \Whoops, I dialed the wrong phone number\ after we came up to get seated.Overall, we found both the food and the service really mediocre. The gnocchi was really lacking in flavor and the dirty little school girls I ordered were definitely little, but too expensive and not dirty enough. Their steak was overly seasoned for my liking, but the soft pretzel appetizers we had were a hit with our table. They also did a better job with the birthday desserts they brought out - an apple pie slice with vanilla ice cream and a butterscotch concoction topped with caramel popcorn - which I thought were refreshing twists to the traditional cake and ice cream other places serve. They had an in-house band that was playing that night, but they were too loud so it was hard to carry on a conversation because we really had to scream at each other to hear anything over the music.

It came to me with tons on quality turkey and homemade stuffing on white toast. Like Thanksgiving in April for my palette... Yum! Other sandwiches included BLT, Reuben, Albacore Tuna, Curry Chicken Salad and several \Pressed\ sandwiches along with some tasty lookin salads. They bill this place as healthy and organic so that could be considered a plus too. I liked the overall experience and I will definitely be going back...

983,2.6,"My husband and I were on our way to the Tempe Sports Complex to play in my work softball tournament and needed to find a place to get a fast, hearty, and affordable lunch. We had originally planned to go to the Mongolian BBQ place nearby (called YC's, I think) but pulled in and realized that it would probably take too long to do the whole pick your meats, veggies, and sauce thing (we only had 20 minutes or so to get lunch and get to the field). That was when we spotted Gandolfo's and decided to give it a try. The menu was huge and really overwhelming, especially since we were in a hurry, but we both just picked something and ordered. He chose the New Yorker (roast beef sandwich served hot with pepper jack, feta, lettuce, tomato, onion, pepperoncini, butter, mayo, and oil and vinegar) and I got the Knickerbocker (which had roast beef, provolone, lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, oil & vinegar, and salt & pepper) served hot. After we paid, we ended up waiting quite a while for our sandwiches  to be prepared, especially given how few people were inside. I probably wouldn't return during a weekday lunch knowing that it's not super-speedy. If you are planning to go there for lunch, make sure it's on a day where you don't need to grab your food and be back ASAP. Maybe calling ahead would help in that case. Also, even though the sandwiches were definitely satisfying,  they weren't outstanding. My husband, who's originally from New Jersey, didn't think the sandwiches were nearly as good as ones he's had on the East Coast. And, yes, I know we're in Phoenix, but the restaurant (which is a chain, btw) has chosen to call itself ew York Delicatessen,\ which in all fairness, can raise a customer's expectations! I also thought the regular size of the sandwich was a bit small. If you are a big eater, I would definitely get the large. Lest you think all I have to say about Gandolfo's sandwiches is negative, I will spend a second praising the hero roll the sandwiches came on, which was freshly baked and super satisfying. I would definitely eat at Gandolfo's again if I were in the area and had time to wait for a sandwich, but I'm unlikely to go out of my way for it.",BCVFlUVM,713

Thinking maybe it was just a mistake, maybe they accidentally gave me the wrong meat, i didn't think to go back since i live about 30mi away. So, when I went back today, I made sure to check they were putting the 90% \lean\ meat into the bag and giving me the correct one. Well, nevertheless, I come home to compare it to the one I previously bought and it's the exact same thing!! i've never seen ground beef look like that, let alone the \lean\ one!I also bought boneless chicken thighs, i brought it home, opened the bag and it stunk!! the chicken had completely gone bad! my first experience with spoiled chicken!  i plan to never go back again!--let me update my review and go from giving baiz 2 stars to just 1!from the same trip as described above, i had also bought \shish tawook\ which is the pre-marinated chicken..let me tell you, i ate that for dinner and was up all night for 3 days and spend 4 hours in the ER to find out that i had \gastroenteritis\ (the stomach flu) from eating their contaminated chicken! I ended up throwing out $70 worth of chicken/beef.FYI, STAY AWAY FROM THE MEAT DEPARTMENT!!!",KYpN5eb1,4749
1005,1.4,I started as a CSM member for their dairy which meant driving 30 minutes from Central Phoenix to Scottsdale for my pick-up every other week. But it was always worth it for fresh local milk,d9CYMAiw,4940
1006,3.9,The first time we stepped into this place we fell head over heals in love! It's got everything we've ever wanted! The place was clean for a buffet,Xh1Xu5wO,1419

1010,1.1,"The food was okay for a complete dinner, a good value for $8.00 with 20% coupon in the Chinese newspaper. They have the typical Chinese food, orange chicken, sweet sour pork, chow main, hot & sour soup, wonton soup, and, sushi.  The sushi is filled with crab meat and cucumber, looked pretty much the same style.   Nothing fancy about it!  The only standout dishes for me were the salt and pepper shrimp, steam clams, and ice creams.  I do like their green tea ice cream and pineapple sherbet.   The hibachi grill selections were limited.  The items didn't look too fresh, so skipped the grill.  They have a so called \Prime Rib\, don't be fooled by the name.  It was unchewable!  We were trying to figure out what kind of meat it was.  Haha....I do give them another star for keeping the food hot and stocking the trays.  Superior service for a buffet place!  They actually have a free Wifi password on the price board.   For the price of a Starbucks coffee, you can fest all day and work!",wtxKx6xC,1187
1011,3.3,The food was delicious,4ZAI0NNc,2182
1012,4.7,Been there twice both times Disappointed.  First visit I tired a sandwich Besides being well overpriced for what you get to begin with a friend with me asked for a little Balsamic vinegar however that would be an up charge.  Sodas come in bottles so if you drink more and one it of course cost you more.   The food was not bad but I would not describe it as great either the bead was hard to bite through tough and grilled hard on the outside.  Second time I was sort of dragged back in we a group was headed to another place when everyone besides me was all wanting to go try it.  So I go in with intentions of spending a bit more for a pasta dish remembering how I left hungry with a sandwich last time.  BAD IDEA I bought the Spaghetti very lack luster simple pasta and tomato sauce the noodles were cooked quite well but the sauce reminded me of that hunts canned sauce I use to by when I was on a tight budget fresh out of college.  Garlic bread.. oh wait I forgot no bread everything is up charged I didn't go past the 16 bucks I was already spending for the so so tiny portion of pasta I was already given and a soda. I figured I would be better off finding the vending machine in the office later for filler.Bottom line for me Decent tasting food very small portions High prices will not return even if the group all decides that's where they are going again.  Why spend that much for lunch and still have to find something more to eat on the way back to the office?,i7PynIHb,501
1013,3.2,Went here after work for happy hour only because Sakana sushi was closed which was a bummer cuz I really was craving their sushi but anyways...it was kinda dead the time we went and we got seated right away but ummm we waited over like 10 mins for the waitress and it took her foreverrr to get our water & drinks!  My friend ordered the Hello Kitty drink for me and he ordered some dark beer. Later she comes back with the wrong beer and my drink ends up being really bland. It was gross.  We ordered the Frighten Geisha,4k2DtF4O,709
1014,2.7,OMG! This place is HORRIBLE! If you want to be harrassed,Vz8jfAad,2943
1015,2.8,Rented a couple mountain bikes with a friend from work yesterday.  Great experience.   5 minutes outside AOA's front door we were trekking through the AZ outback...a great ride.  Staff was friendly and knowledgable.  Provided several options for local trails,oi75su9m,1428
1016,3.1,"Been hearing a lot about this place, mixed reviews from different people. So glad that I finally get to go try it for myself. As soon as I stepped in to the restaurant, it is already a \Like\ ... playing some really awesome cuban cha-cha-cha music and the atmosphere was great. A very cute place and love the bee-hive in the middle. As for the food, had the empanaditas ... very good, and the puerto rican sampler was a good way to try couple of things at once.  Overall food was pretty good .... it's not like \WOW\ type of food ... but good for my tummy.  Will certainly go back on a Friday/Saturday night when they have the live band playing to do some cha-cha or salsa ;-) Recommended !!!",1VqFGgB2,4222
1017,3.2,The prices are wonderful. And yes,JbzfAt2g,2706
1018,2.9,This place was fun and made for a good meal after a morning of shopping.  Conveniently located in Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall.  We ordered the salsa trio as an appetizer and all 3 were very good although our favorite was the avocado tomatillo.  the waiter asked us several times if we wanted cornbread and we said yes because we wanted to try it but it never arrived which was ok because we had plenty to eat and our table was quite small but I'm still left wondering how it would have tasted.  I had the green chile barbacoa enchiladas at the recommendation of the waiter and I was not disappointed.   while we didn't have any drinks there was a fun make your own drink bar with all the fixings you could ever want to mix with your alcohol.  would make for a fun happy hour place.  overall a very nice restaurant for a lunchtime shopping break.,osVWwBFC,785
1019,3.8,"Supercalifragilisticexpealidocious. I'm serious. It's that good. And I'm talking everything here. The food (priority number one for me), the atmosphere, the service... EXCELLENT.This was  my second time back and I was even more blown away... I got shivers, I closed my eyes, I made \mmmm\ sounds. I think I embarrass Kyle when we go out to eat... whatever I like my food beezies!I ordered the Caprese sandwich again... the bread was a little crispy and made my mouth hurt but it still tasted like it was made by the gods. Instead of the caprese pasta salad (which is BOMB) I got the sweet potato pasta salad which was extremely good! I was SO FULL. Kyle got the Picnic sandwich, which had him talking about flavor combos and \mmm-ing\ to himself... so I'm not the only one here people. So even though we were full I'm a dessert person I made Kyle share the bread pudding with me.... WORTH IT. It's smothered in the best whipped cream I've ever tasted and it's so eggy and delectable I died a little.We also had coffee! The barista was awesome, so friendly and he recommended Kyle try the cortadito which was sweet but so perfectly blended with the espresso that I almost drank his whole drink instead of mine. I got a soy latte which was just ok bc the soy milk flavor was too strong. everyone was so helpful and friendly here. The busser even stopped to tell me the bread pudding is made with their cinnamon roll bread! Ahhhh-mazing!SO GO HERE",ASewbN5T,213
1020,2.9,"AJs is an incredibly beautiful store, so much so that to me it's like a dream:  imagine a museum of all kinds of delicious food, but it's food that we can eat.  The problem I have with this place is the cost.    This is not a competitor of Frys or Safeway. AJs is for the well-to-do, the well-heeled (which I'm definitely not) and wannabes.  I only come here  for the white chocolate rum marble cake - everyone that has this cake, loves it.  I've heard \this is the best cake I've ever eaten\ from everyone that tastes it.  We only found this by accident.  We needed a cake and didn't want to pay upwards of $30.00.  We saw on AJs website that they reduce the cost of one cake each month from $25 to $20.  This cake happened to be the one that was on sale, so that's what we ended up with.  We couldn't believe how good it was.  Much better than any cake we've ever bought elsewhere and paid considerably more for (Does anyone besides me belive that TammieCoe is completely overpriced?).  Every time we need cake (because who has time anymore to bake a cake, wait for it to cool, make frosting, and then try to get it to look good), this is the one we get.  Don't wait until the last minute - order in advance.  They don't have every cake listed on their website in stock.",woDPK29e,1866
1021,1,Sit at the ceviche bar and strike up a conversation with the chefs. They are super friendly and the open kitchen is fun for foodies. The ceviche is off the hook! Try the lobster tacos and rainbow ceviche with a glass of champagne or sparkling wine. (they need a tasting menu)  The foie gras and fig empanadas are decadent and both the bone-in rib-eye and chimichurri beef tenderloin are cooked to perfection and flavorful. We need a restaurant like this is Cali!,dfcu4RA7,2445
1022,2.1,I was there Friday night to play some cards and then we got hungry.  Selected asian entrees -Chow Mein with Shrimp and Green Curry with chicken.  Both were delish  Then I looked over to the neighboring table and saw how beautiful the steak fries looked.  I asked the waitress (Lisa) about them and she told me they were seasoned fries and very good.  I have never seen any large steak fries like that seasoned.  Next time I will order those fries.  Lisa our waitress kept the water glasses filled and served us in a timely and friendly manner.  thank you Lisa!  I will be back!,LzhMSYal,1232
1023,1.2,"This place is in the same complex as my nail salon but I have not stopped in to this location. I have been to their Scottsdale location and love it!This location does not disappoint. Service is quick and while they prefer cash, the ATM is on site and they offer a discount if you pay cash so no problem. I had the Nam Sod and ordered it Thai hot and yes it was! I hate when I order \Thai hot\ and it comes out just a little fiery. Make me sweat, people! The texture was lovely, it wasn't dry and the serving was huge! I easily could have shared it and ended up with two meals out of it. I will definitely make this a post-nail appointment dining spot from now on.",FiLWxE1O,1464
1024,2.1,"I'm sad it's taken me over a year of living just down the road to finally make it to Bobby Q.  I think it was because I moved from Florida, where BBQ is delicious and cheap, and I was reluctant to \splurge\ on pulled pork at a place like this.  The ambiance is fantastic, you feel great walking in.  The last star was left off for service, which I wasn't a huge fan of.  We were attended to just fine, but I wasn't a fan of our waiter's demeanor.  He didn't seem to know the menu well, which is a shame because it isn't huge.  I kind of felt like he was reading a script, emphasizing the whole \smoked for 18 hours\ thing, which rubbed me the wrong way.But aside from the waiter not being invited to my Christmas party, the place was great.  The food was really delicious, and well worth the money.  I believe that with an appetizer, any 2 people could easily share any entree.  I do have to say this - if you go, do NOT skip out on the banana dessert.  OUT OF THIS WORLD.  I am a freak for banana pudding, but this treat is on a whole new level.  It was thick and custardy, cold and delicious.  The best part was the crust, which was almost granola-esque.  I've never had anything like it, and doubt I ever will... until I go back to Bobby Q for some more!",6abBi9I5,4870
1025,4.3,Another great spot in my neighboorhood! I had never eaten and a Planet Sub so I perused the menu and the gentleman behind the counter offered some advise.  I settled on the Chicken Parmesan sub and a cup of Chicken Enchilada soup.  My daughter got the kids meal with a grilled cheese,sKjogp45,2216
1026,3.8,Pretty much standard Chinese buffet with some additional seafood items.  When I was there they had chicken feet which I felt obligated to try.  Not a good move.  I'm pretty sure they had frog legs too.  So if you're looking for some extra adventurous food,iaXhNG7R,4171
1027,1.1,"We were in Phoenix on business and went to Kincaid's for dinner. We have a gluten allergy and usually find steak and seafood places to have \safe\ options for us. Our waiter was friendly and asked if we had any questions on the menu. We asked if they had a gluten free menu and he said no.  Then we asked about some of the menu items to see how they were prepared so we can determine if they were gluten free.  The waiter left and sent the manager over.The manager was very unhelpful and said everything on the menu had gluten in it. Even their mashed potatoes and all sauces and dressings.  Then we asked if we could get a grilled piece of fish with no sauce. He said all the fish was already prepared with the sauces and crusts on them. The only thing we could eat on the menu was the scallops...but they were out of scallops. He said there was a book in the kitchen of the ingredients for all of their dishes but the book was too big to look through. The table of 5 next to us were unhappy because the manager said he was too busy to split their check for them into two payments. We were so turned off by the lack of customer satisfaction that this manager demonstrated for us and for the table next to us.After going through this for 45 minutes, we left frustrated and hungry and drove 5 miles to Ruth's Chris where we had the most amazing dinner you can imagine. They had a gluten free menu, amazing service and the Chefs did not miss a beat on anything!I will never go to Kincaid's again. Terrible experience.",7QAoPuU5,4439

1038,3.2,"My favorite part of this place is the massage chairs and the foot massages they give!I've been here twice.  The first time wasn't great, but I liked my toenails.  I got there early and they put me in a chair to soak my feet with water that was freezing cold.  The second time was better, but I didn't love my nail designs.  It came out looking like a \Bollywood\ design.  I guess next time I should be more specific about what type of design I want instead of just saying I want nail art.  They have a lot of colors, but they seem to have a lot of the dark reds and not as much in the light pink department.  I thought about bringing in my own color.I like that they give you a list of options to choose from so that you know exactly what everything is and what it costs.",FdwovMQx,3091

1049,3.2,Where do I begin...this is a compilation of my last three visits to RCSH and my experiences were all the same.  Why go back?  I was given a number of gift cards over the last couple years and used each one.  I now ask that I NOT be given anything to do with this restaurant..  Here are the reasons:1.  Confirmed reservations were ignored or not honored.  The final visit resulted in an hour wait.  Yea that was a great anniversary visit waiting at the bar.2.  The staff is uniformly ignorant about customer service.  Is it so hard to take less than 30 minutes to come and take the order?  Can you come back sometime again during the meal?  Why do I wait another half hour to be asked if I want coffee and dessert once my plate is removed? Does each visit really have to take 2 and a half hours? I exempt the bus staff as they tried.3.  The food is ordinary...no comparison to The Capital Grille or others.4.  Each and every time we had such bad service we were given free desserts.  They clearly understood that our experience was bad.Please FIX 1,PubSk6VT,2399
1050,3.9,I was really looking forward to eating here. I went online and salivated over the menu. I got there and this is what I ordered.Spicy Tuna-Super fishy and the rice was oily. The sea weed was tough tooBeef Skewers- It was very Tender but not very good flavor. Certainly not worth the priceRangoon- This was actually really good but the sauce was terrible and Im sure from a frozen package. I would bet money they dont make the sauces or the rangoon in store.

1054,2.2,My husband and I went to CG with no reservation truly hoping to eat in the bar.    We could sit right away and proceeded to get the worst service we have ever encountered.  The bartenders were a man and woman and were actually bickering at each other the whole night in front of the customers.  They looked disheveled and acted completely overwhelmed.  We had to beg for service......and even tried to waive to get attention.  We had to ask several times for wine,W1TVjH89,3192
1055,2.1,"To get this out of the way up front, the storefront picture here appears not to be the Tempe location. Maybe it's the Mesa place?  The Tempe location is tucked in the corner of a dingy mall far out of the Mill Ave nightlife.  There is barely a sign on the building, the windows are painted dark black with an old photo mural theme, the door leads into a narrow black corridor with no greeter.  It looks like a bar with a few 2-person tables and that's all ... until you accidentally discover that the bar (with barstools) is actually a \kitchen\ with no alcohol and that if you wend your way around the end of the bar, passing the restrooms, you will find the actual dining room and drinking bar.  We ate in the kitchen/bar and only later happened upon that discovery and that there is second equally dark and foreboding door that goes to the main dining room.The employees seemed to all guys, with a distinct aura of all being bikers, but they were super-friendly and acceptably attentive.  Assuming the food is made from scratch, the 20 - 30 minute wait to be served was also acceptable.  You can pass the time enjoying an excellent selection of draft and bottled beers.At $6.50, my Oggie pasty was a good value.  The crust was tender and flakey and the meat was tasty.  I learned from this my first experience with rutabaga that I am not a fan of rutabaga, but that's not their fault. The amount of filling was roughly what you get in one of those tiny 99 cent pot pies in the frozen food section of the supermarket.  The brown-wine gravy was yummy.The place sends a confusing message. It absolutely looks like a college dive (and I probably would be there all the time if I attended ASU) but it's quite a hike from campus. It's not Scottsdale funky (yea!!), and if you are wearing anything fancier than a tee shirt and jeans you would definitely feel out of place.  It's a curiously quiet place, none of the ribaldry you would find at an Irish pub (the canned music was mostly soft rock of the 70's and 80's).Bottom line - it's rare to find a good pasty in this area, and these are good.  As the rating states, it's A-OK.",6ucuuUUc,1863
1056,3.4,"I was told this place used to be the \hot spot\  back in the day.  My review is strictly based on the bar and teppan experience(I have not tried their sushi yet).  We had 9 in our group on a Thursday night and we started off with a round of beers at the bar.  It's a nice touch that every beer we ordered came with a small bottle of sake!  The bar is small and we pretty much took up the whole area, which also happens to be right where the front door of the place is.There are a few teppan tables in the very back of the place, and our group of 9 just barely fit comfortably.  The \show\ before the cooking started was one of the better ones I've seen(it was the first time I've seen them light a trail of fire around the table and into each of our dinner plates!).  I ordered steak and lobster with fried rice, and it turned out pretty delicious.  One disappointment I had during the cooking process was that the fried rice was not prepared for us on the grill...it came out in bowls straight from the kitchen.  The miso was ok, nothing to write home to mom about.They do NOT have \golden shrimp\(I'm beginning to think no teppan place in Arizona has this).Bathrooms are small and kind of grungy(1 urinal, 1 stall, 1 sink).",sdKzQSAu,2534
1057,2.7,"This is a \halfway\ review because we didn't order any food at the Livng Room and will never go there to eat. My husband and i stopped in on a Sunday evening. It was monsoonyish out so there was no one seated outside but the inside was busy. The bar was full and the tables in the main food area were almost full. We had fun. It was a great place to people watch. The music was excellent. A female singer. But in watching people we noticed that the service in the restaurant was horrible. There was one waitress that we were enthralled by because she looked like she was about to kill herself and moved like a snail. We watched her try to smile at a customer and it was... well.. sad. Our server was the only server in the bar. She was literally running and it was still slow. There were two servers in the food area and they were both really slow moving. the one who didn't look like she wanted to kill herself sure did't appear enthused. And the wine by the glass list is just \okay\. Nothing interesting on it. Just some basic mid range wines. This is a good happy hour place. Somewhere to get drinks, watch single people (or married ones who wanna be), have some laughs. But it doenst look like a dinner place.",sFOXVBDr,3896

1059,3,LOVE THIS PLACE!  We eat here every Saturday as long as we are in town.  My husband eats here during the week too!  Weekday lunches are a great deal and quick!  The veggie soup is delicious.  The golden wings - Delicious... chicken satay is good too.  For an entree... we always get Pad Prik King chicken or sometimes shrimp but its always always delicious!  Have been trying to find a thai place with this dish closer to home (east valley) but haven't found one yet!  Service is terrific!  FYI for those of you who just order Pad Thai... it is very sweet here so if you don't like it sweet... order something else.  Other things we've tried that were good... pepper steak - very good - just dont eat a lot of red meat,9The9KxA,146
1060,4.4,"I want to know what kind of crack everyone that says this place is the bomb and has great food is smoking, and I want some for myself so that I may smoke it and become just as high.The food presentation is great and the place is pretty chill. The servers are nice too. It looked like a Gap ad or something inside. They also had an interesting concept and a nice menu. The water had cucumber slices in it which was pretty nice as well. That's where the good times end though...They have 80 half bottles of wine to choose from... Half bottles. Tiny little bottles that contain a little more than a glass each. Plus the prices are closer to a whole bottle... whatever. At least the food prices seem more reasonable.The caesar salad we ate was composed of wilted lettuce and the dressing smelled a little off... did not finish. The \tater tots\ we had were crispy and all, but they were undersalted and tasted like fake potato... did not finish. Finally, the sliders we had were charred nuggets of coal on the outside, but red and raw on the inside... completely fucking disgusting... did not finish. In fact, I started feeling quite ill halfway through one tiny burger.And really - these are 3oz burger patties... how long does it take to cook these things? They obviously stuck them right into a raging fire until blackened and dry and then pulled them out before the middle was cooked enough to be safe to eat - that couldn't take more than a few minutes, right? The bread was stale too. I can tell you that these aren't sliders as much as they are bits of charcoal with a raw meat surprise inside... as long as it took for them to cook and bring these tiny disasters out to us, it's definitely going to take me longer to pass these stones - I actually debated heading straight to the bathroom to vomit them up dreading the thought of having to poo them out later.The wait seemed excessive for everything really. The place wasn't even very busy - perhaps it was because our waitress was busy chasing down some out of town dick. I guess when you're paying nearly 70 bucks for two people (with one half-bottle of wine included), you expect things to go a little smoother than say a McDonalds... but seriously - even though it's been about a decade since I've eaten at McDonalds, I remember them having pretty good service and reliable food. Stax is like McDonalds, but 10x the price and 1/2 the quality.This place has potential though, so judging from the other reviews - perhaps this was an isolated experience. Your mileage may vary._______________________________Edit: After writing this, I found out that I know the chef here... so now I feel bad. I hope he wasn't on duty when I ate there. I may give it another shot, but honestly it'll be tough since both my girlfriend and I got sick eating here. I've eaten his food before and he's really talented... this was simply awful though, so I'm just going to assume he didn't cook it.",mzmnvGn4,919

1062,4.4,"The husband and I love this place. We have been coming here ever since we moved to the neighborhood and both the food and service is consistently amazing. We have tried most of the breakfast menu but haven't dived into the lunch menu. Our favorite is the Gouda brizza (breakfast pizza) - smoked gouda, bacon, hollandaise sauce, and scrambled eggs. Yum! On lazy weekends, we order this to go and enjoy back at our place. When we dine in, it's a mix. Their Costa breakfast burrito is delicious - something the husband orders frequently. I really like their mushroom and bacon omelet, but I also enjoy their \two eggs anyway\ meal. I normally get scrambled eggs, bacon, pancakes, and fruit (instead of potatoes). Super delicious and filling. Another favorite are the Biscuits and Gravy. Now this is amazing! The biscuits are super soft on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. They just melt in your mouth! The gravy is the perfect accompaniment. It's thick and filled with sausage. These are some of the best B&Gs I've had! The best part is how inexpensive yet utterly delicious they are! I love that it's a local place that uses local food. Everything is fresh and the staff is outstanding. We've taken both sets of parents here as well as friends. This is definitely the go-to breakfast place. If you are ever in the area, you should definitely check it out!",BUeHqLvN,3398

I generally don't like sandwiches much, but this one hit the spot.  Half of it filled me up so they wrapped the rest to take home, but the other half didn't even last until dinner. I couldn't imagine what they could do to make things better there...maybe start serving breakfast?I have, however, come to the conclusion that the folks that work there are pure evil disguised in aprons.  How else could you explain the way they ever so sweetly point out the most delectable treats to tempt you?  \Have you seen how big our rice krispie treats are?\  \There's a pound of fruit in our cobblers if you want your kids to eat more fruit\  Oh, I'm on to you!",qbSIxBUT,4220
1074,2.6,"A friend of ours recommended Luu's to us a few months back.  We were sold after our first visit and been back several satisfying times.  I usually get the pork bowl.  The meat is very tender and the vegetables are ALWAYS fresh and perfectly cooked.  The various sauces are a perfect compliment.  They have a super tasty hot sauce that Jeannie and I really like.  Jeannie usually gets the chicken bowl ( my kids have had them too and they devoured it!) or a salad ( the salad is just a salad, but it like everything is prepared well and always fresh) and she has never been disappointed with her meals. Like Mark G. said, the preparation and delivery are always solid and they show a true interest in customer satisfaction.I always order a egg roll. Ordering an egg roll at most Asian \fast food\ places is always a let down for me. They always seem to be on the extremely greasy side or heat lamp dehydrated,  and usually packed with ancient overcooked  fixings. However, the ones at Luu's are always super flaky, and filled with fresh and tasty fillings.  We were talked into some crab puffs on our last visit.  Not sure I would give up my egg roll for them, but they were very good.  I think the order came with six little golden purses of sweet crab filling.  We had to fight over them because everyone in this family of four wanted seconds!  I figured I had enough fried food in the form of my treasured egg roll and I wasn't about to share that bad boy.Have to expand our menu selections.

I went there today and was totally saddened that they closed BUT I asked the owner of the little snack place next to this place and he said they MOVED somewhere to MESA located on BROADWAY or something. We gotta see if this is true! I mean, it might not be open YET but this is the only lead I have! RIP HUACHINANGO (for now hopefully)UPDATE:I scoured the internet and found Huauchinango's facebook.

We tasted several appetizers....and most were extremely good. The Cobb Salad was seriously delicious, and we had to taste the Louisiana inspired dish, which was tasty (although a bit heavy, as was to be expected). The fried shrimp were just okay. We had a splendid wine, selected by our waiter (Fiddlehead, a white from California). Our two biggest complaints were the service (very slow...it's not a sin to keep the drinks coming!) and the main course. Although the food was good, it was a lot of sauces and \stuff\ piled on top of each other. Some would say that this is what chefs do to pretend to have talent...I am not sure I would take it that far, but it would have been nice to be able to taste each meat or fish or item on the plate as an individual flavor. We were way too stuffed for dessert.We'd go back, but probably not for a while....it was just a little too unique and heavy for frequent visits.",Q0gAZRJr,3507

1084,4.6,"I consider myself a pastrami connoisseur.   I experienced Scotts first time through Living Social, $5 for $10 worth before 11 am only.  I had \hot\ pastrami, but the pastrami was not hot at all, not even warm.   Just room temp, but very lean, even tho I did not order extra lean.  It was terribly salty, and not much peppercorn taste.  I felt the price was quite expensive $10.95 for what you get, and the sandwich was not that big.  The rye bread very soft, the kind that compresses to dough on our meat, when you hold it..  Bread size is the same as an ordinary square loaf of sandwich bread.  The cole slaw was the tiniest serving I'd ever been served in my life.   Wimpy and translucent cabbage, just one tablespoon in one of those tiny \dipping sauce\ plastic cups for sauce to go, barely wide enough to stick your fork into that tiny cup.  The only thing I really liked, was the  pickles.  The waitress overcharged me for my sandwich, $12.50 instead of $10.95 it said on the menu.  When I drew that to her attention, she said she was thinking of something else, and apologized.  I'd rather buy pastrami from a deli, a loaf of rye bread, and make my own, even for the $8 I paid with tax and tip ($5 Living Social plus tax and tip).   Not coming back to this place.",pJLfzkcZ,374

Then, before you can place your order, the asshole interrupts your well prepared sonnet about a number three and a diet coke asking for money. How fucked is that?This caused me to roll up my window, (like any good American) relying on my overly tinted windows to shield me from his view. Unfettered by my sly window moves, he simply refused to shoo. This caused me to roll down my window and bust-out my best Spanish where I warned him to move away from the vehicle.

1093,4.6,"First time to the Ostrich Festival 2012. My wife and I paid $10 each to gain entrance after giving $5 to park about 2-3 blocks from the event. We went on Saturday around Noon and the place was packed- particularly the food area and midway/carnival sections. There was so much to take in, it was pretty impressive how large and spread out the entire festival was- from the petting zoo to the food vendors to the carnival area- it must have been the size of 3-4 football fields. Food: Many selections to choose from but mostly catering to the carnival fun fare. Lots of \deep fried\ items- from pickles to cream cheese. And then you have your corn dogs, burgers, funnel cakes, and kettle corn. We selected mexican food and ordered the chicken quesadilla and it was pretty tasty ($8 for basically 1 tortilla folded in half though) with a $3 coke that was gross. We also tried strawberry lemonade which was decent but very sweet. But a wide variety of foods- we saw McDonald's was on site as well- interesting to see that big of a brand there since everything else was what you'd expect from the state fair.Entertainment: Lots of variety here, mainly aimed towards smaller kids. There was a Western show with gunslinging, a Monkey show, Petting Zoo (large but packed so we avoided), a \Bubble\ show, Magic show, and then a large music stage for live acts that performed throughout the day with headliner in evening (our night was Blue Oyster Cult). Overall there were lots to choose from although they start at exact times throughout the day so if you arrive at Noon like we did you miss a lot until things start back up around 2p. Looked like there was plenty of room to cater a large crowd of people with chairs in some of the more popular shows.Fun/Rides: There are 2 sections- adults and kids. Both are equally large with the adults area a bit bigger. I'd say there were at least a dozen thrill rides with 2 ferris wheels, a fun house, and haunted attraction. The midway was pretty cool with all of the games to \win\ prizes. A great place to lose a lot of money trying to win a five foot tall Bart Simpson if you're not careful. The folks running each game station throw out their typical challenges and heckles, always fun to be called out in front of your family when you decide not to pay $5 to throw softballs at a laundry basket for a sack of goldfish. :- PThe event was very organized- and the main attraction of course are the ostriches. You can visit them at the end of the festival grounds where there are 2 or 3 penned up for your viewing. Interestingly they sell ostrich burgers about 50 yards from where these giant birds dwell. There's also ostrich racing, which was not happening while we were there- but I'd imagine it's a few big bird running in circles as people cheer on a winner.Overall it was a pretty fun time- there are numerous things to do, especially if you're with a little one (we brought our 1 year old daughter and she was constantly in awe of her surroundings). Be prepared to shell out some money- between parking, admission, fare tickets ($25 tix for $23 and each ride is 4-5 tickets), food, snacks, drinks, souvenirs. etc. - you're easily staring at over $100 to do a little of everything. Check the event's web site as they pre-sell wristbands at Fry's Food for a deep discount and I believe it's all access wristbands for the carnival rides. Have fun and bring plenty of sunscreen and water to keep hydrated. We found local firefighters and police booths selling ice cold bottles of water for $1.",x4xfVTia,3166

The ot your typical\ chicken lasagna is also a solid choice.   Show up early and grab a drink in bar north. Bar north also has a nice vibe, but the main restaurant is more happening and has an overall more trendy vibe. If you're going to sit inside, we prefer the main dining room rather than the bar north dining room (same menu at both though).

Get a ride from someone, because you'll probably want another :) The decor is cool and they play French movies on a large screen in the back of the restaurant. I also have a special place in my heart for their awesome sweet potato fries!

The chicken sliders are amazing - my favorite item so far, and with $3 off during happy hour (regularly $8.99) it's a great deal too!  FYI, the \hot\ wings aren't that hot - the \atomic\ are perfect if you like typical \hot\ wings.  Yum.  Oh, also, during their happy hour they have martinis for $4.50!  Finally, if you're looking for a good place to watch sports, this is perfect as they have HD flat screen tvs everywhere - not a bad seat in the entire bar.  This will be one of our regular spots for sure.The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was that last time we went the server was just \OK\ so I'm not sure if it's hit or miss since our server tonight was exceptional.",SQ1ux9Ix,924

The green peppers looked diseased and the red peppers were insanely expensive for what they are!  And that's to say nothing of the organic produce which is some of the most expensive organic produce I've ever seen.  Produce was really the whole reason I came in so it was disappointing.They have a large deli section which is nice in addition to \regular\ groceries.  I have to say that I wasn't impressed with the grocery selection, from the frozen foods to the bread it was just ok.  The liquor department was meager and not well organized.

Left and came back about an hour and half later...no line, lots of parking.Ordered the farm burger and 2 hot dogs...that and two drinks....$23.  Hamburger -- nothing special.  Came with two leaves of partially brown lettuce and two rather anemic looking rings of red onion...not two slices...two rings.Hot dogs -- actually not bad.  Came with onion and \homemade\ relish.  Fries that came with the above we ok, but again nothing special.So what's my assessment?- Nothing special.- Way expensive.- Odd that they're a \farm\ restaurant but yet they had such sad looking produce.- Glad I didn't have to wait in line...I wouldn't be a happy camper if I did.- Places to get a better burger...especially on a price to quality ratio...In and Out, Five Guys, Fudruckers.One final point that ranks somewhere between weird and disgusting.  The drink/condiment station shares the same drainage trough.  So when you're down stream from the condiments getting your soda you get to watch ketchup, mayo, ranch dressing, etc float by you as you get your soda.

1119,2.8,"I go to a lot of 24 Hour Fitness locations across the valley, and this definitely is not a favorite of mine. I also have gone to the locations since I lived in TX, so for about 6 years now. This location is a bit run-down compared to the nice newer gyms (8th St in Mesa, Metroplex off the 17; Chandler, Gilbert, etc), and the machines are not always up to speed. There are several treadmills that say \Error 7\ after a few minutes, yet they're always broken.  I have had to hop on and off several treadmills to finally find one that works.  There are always machines broken. I have been injured on and off and could only use a recumbent bike. One's resistance was off and kept slipping, making a workout impossible. Another one was incredibly wobbly, then by the time I got on a bike that worked, an older man gave me the stink eye for taking \his bike\ that apparently he was used to having daily. Out of the nine or 10 stepmills, at least several don't function quite right (either wobbly or go too fast) and several have a sign on them saying that they are under repair. The Pros:- Classes are fun, almost always. The yoga, pilates, Zumba, and kickboxing classes are tons of fun with great instructors, although I don't think there are any true-yoga yoga instructors at this location. The cycle classes are a lot of fun. Go to Carolyn or Anne's cycle classes if you can. I have been going for almost two years and absolutely love these classes!- Medium crowded. I can usually find a machine, for the most part. This gym seems to attract the over-40/50 Arcadia crowd, and the gym gets really busy around 10/11 am on weekdays. Sometimes the bikes are all full at those times.  *If you want in a cycle/spin class especially on Wednesday, Friday, (9:30am) or Saturday mornings (8:30am), you have to get to the gym at least an hour early to get a pass.   I hear that the evening classes are packed too.  - Parking is decent and in a good spot if you want to shop before or after in that Arcadia/Camelback area - close to the 20th Street shops.  However, in the evenings, I have attended yoga and had to park in the lot to the north of the gym (more exercise!) - There is an entire aerobics room with equipment such as medicine balls, weights, and mats to go do your own thing, which is nice. - Childcare (not sure of the hours)The Cons:- Some of the instructors are friendly and others are not. It depends on which class.   Sometimes the front desk people greet me, sometimes not at all. - Some classes can get super packed to the point  almost too close for comfort.  - In the cycle room if you have sensitive ears like me, the music can seem really really loud. (But always a fun class) - The weights area can get really crowded, and some of those guys take up several machines at once or just sit on a bench staring into space for 10 minutes. - Cardio machines are often not working. Although it's likely I can find one, there are often \sorry this machine is under repair\ signs on several pieces of equipment.  The StepMills are popular, and there are at least three to four not working at any one time, plus some of them are weird and jerky, so I don't bother.  Also, the elliptical machines and treadmills are often not in best shape, so I have to keep switching machines to find one that works.  - Some machines are outdated. - The locker room is sometimes a bit grungy and often overly hot, because the a/c doesn't work in there. Some of the cycle class crew had said that there were some thefts in the locker room. - There were a few weekends where the A/C was leaking water all over the area where the treadmills are located.  Also the A/C has not always worked in cycle room (ick!)- The room where one can go and stretch, etc. is often packed to where one cannot find a spot to do any sort of exercises. Compared to many other nicer newer gyms in the valley, this one could use some updates and a bit more friendliness.",ovLNpALt,4835

1125,2.7,THE JUMP OFF! As a new Arizonian a friend suggested this pace for live music and non pretentious dance. This is the kind off place where people go who know. A tiny dance floor with eclectic characters from all walks of live surrounding and coming in and off the dance floor with their date when the funky beat touches them right. The music is on point ranging from Earth Wind and Fire to Blackstreet Boys. The band is fantastic and really collaborates with the crowd energy.

1129,2.5,"My first time eating at Jobot! The number 4 with corn tortillas rocked my socks, sooo delicious! I felt healthy, light, satisfied and delighted when eating each bite. Just hit the spot! I shared the other two tacos with friends and they adored it just the same! The ingredients and flavor palate was intriguing & melt-worthy.To drink, I had the African Rose tea which was a refreshing, beautiful field of flowers on my taste buds. I also had a chai after hearing a rave review about it from a local bookstore owner. I am a chai freak and after hearing about how good it was... I just had to try it! It was literally the best chai I've ever had. The perfect blend of spice and sweet. Felt like it was made just for my taste. Chai lattes are often overly sweet or powerfully spicy (the intensity of the spice overpowers the chai), but Jobot's recipe was puuuuuurrrfect. A mouthful of orgasmic bliss at each swallow.And the environment was very warm and welcoming, friendly faces and great service! Art on the walls of \local community heroes\ by Aaron was great to see! And extra bonus, Jobot is located right next to Aaron's bookstore, Lawn Gnome Publishing & Bookstore! My first time there as well. It is a breath of positivity, inspiration and creativity! I will be definitely frequenting them both! Visit Jobot & Lawn Gnome now! ;D",8daNdVam,2021

It has become one of my all-time favorite places to eat now. I am usually a little bit on the frugal side but with this place I do make an exception. It cost me right around $10.00 for a lunch but I have to admit it will make you want to go back everyday. I usually get the pizza cheese steak with grilled onions and peperoni. and a side of frys.... and the awesome dipping sauce. Great dinning experience for sure.

Aside from the navigational clusterfuck, it's gotten really dirty. I don't feel incredibly safe with the loiterers and drunks that hang out by Dave and Buster's and Cadillac Ranch either.

This baby is huge and perfectly crisp on the outside and loaded with delicious moist crab on the inside.  It is served on a bed of avocado and a delicious sauce.

1145,2.8,"My husband and I saw this place when we went to the (amazing) Asian market in the same shopping center, and decided to go back later that night and try it out for dinner.Initially, it looked like your standard not-quite-fast-food place. Not really impressive in terms of decor, but it was clean and bright. Busy on a Saturday night, but not packed. When we sat down and looked at the menu, both of us were almost overwhelmed -- there's quite a bit to choose from and it all sounded so good.We ordered the potstickers as an appetizer, and they were really yummy... and HUGE. I've never seen potstickers that size before. The noodle dishes we ordered were excellent. I got a beef/lemon noodle dish. He ordered noodles with a seafood blend. Really impressed with the quality of the food (and it helped that you can literally see the noodles being made right behind you in the kitchen). Our server told us to \mix up\ the noodles right away so they wouldn't stick together, and that advice was appreciated.We'll definitely go back. The people at the table next to us ordered soup (it looked *fantastic*) and there were a bunch of other dishes on the menu that we'd like to try.",IOnu1dl1,3657

You are the \owner\ of this place, you can cover up just a bit! The \owner\ wasn't the only one dressed... well... ya know.... There were other waitresses dressed the same way!!

I will NOT be bringing my kids here!I also noticed that at first glance, the place looks pretty clean. But WHOA, it is not!

1148,2.9,"I'm just going to go ahead and say that this is my favorite burger place. Whew, glad I got that out there. Now on to why...(a) The meat itself is substantial, flavorful, juicy, and always hot. (b) They offer several different bun varieties, which is unique and awesome. My favorite is the chipotle bun.(c) There are lots and lots of topping options. Some standard, some that challenge the status quo a bit (fried egg, avocado, mushrooms come to mind).(d) AMAZING side dishes. I think I have my perfect \create your own\ burger down, so I get that every time, but I always have a hard time deciding which side to get. Rosemary Smashfries? Sweet potato fries? Haystack onions (with yummy dipping sauce)? Fried pickles? All of these are seriously delicious. (e) Great service. Sometimes the food takes a little but longer, but it's usually very fast. And while you can of course be hit or miss with the staff that's there, some of them are amazingly helpful and friendly.Throw in a great atmosphere and you've got yourself one fantastic meal. And, unlike some other burger places, I don't leave feeling greasy or \weighed down\ by the food - just full, happy, and ready to go back the next day.Smashburger FTW!",cG1n51Pv,3642

I've voluntarily gone here so many times that giving it a 2 star review would make me the fat kid who keeps touching the stove, despite continually getting burned. And I am NOT that fat kid. So back off.I am, however, the fat girl who happens to live nearby the China Olive. And sometimes I get really, really hungry. So hungry, in fact, that in my deluded, nutrient-deprived mind, the only thing that will be able to adequately satiate me would be eating plate after plate of mediocre Chinese food until I either pass out in a food coma, or they close the place for the night.  There is NO WAY just one plate of food will do. That is what my hunger tells me. And I listen to my hunger. However, once I get seated, and have my first egg roll (which are okay) and hot and sour soup (pretty good), I realize that my hunger is fading, and I still have 4 buffet rows of mediocre chinese (and italian, and cajun, and mexican) food to eat. That's when I start to get pissed at my hunger. Because I could have spent the same amount of money elsewhere (about $10 for dinner) and it would have been just as filling and much more enjoyable than the 4 rows of \meh\ I'm working with here.In all fairness, the food isn't that bad.

1154,4.3,"High blood pressure folks, watch your sodium in-take at the District.I had high hopes coming here.  Nice looking place, friendly staff, impressive menu.  I gave it a shot... because, really, there's no way I'm stepping foot in the Hooters across the street.I have this thing with scallops, so when I saw it listed on the menu it was no contest.  However, listed underneath was \mushrooms, peppers, grilled Italian sausage.\  Sausage?  Oh dear, but I don't eat pork.  I asked  the waitress if there was anyway I could substitute the sausage for the grilled asparagus listed under the sides portion of the menu.  She explained that the scallops were served on top of a mixture of the three items, but I could choose to have it served on top of the asparagus instead.  Sure, why not.  That sounds good.  I also ordered the baked tomato soup because of all the great Yelp reviews and good lookin' pictures.While I was waiting for my food, the bread and butter came out.  The bread was sprinkled with what I think was fancy sea salt.  Neat... but was this possibly an indicator of the meal to come?  Soon thereafter, my soup came out.  I didn't even get tomato soup when I was a kid, but I feel like this soup brought me back to childhood.  It was creamy, not over-seasoned at all, and the cheese on top was just right.  I suggest saving one of your dinner rolls to dip in it and you, my friend, have quite the meal.  The soup was pretty hot, so it took me some time to finish it and by then, my scallops were ready.  My bowl was taken away and in it's place were my scallops... in the oddest shaped bowl/dish I've seen.  It was like a huge bowl with an asymmetrical curve so that it's like your food is performing for you in a mini-amphitheater.  It's great for presentation, but a pain to actually eat off of.  I had a hard time resting my utensils on it and it left no room to use a knife and fork.  Made me long for the days of plates and flat surfaces.  The scallops themselves-- 3 huge ones-- were seared to perfection on top of a bunch of supposedly grilled asparagus.  However, EVERYTHING on the plate was overly salty.  I thought maybe my switching of the other ingredients had somehow upset the balance of the poor scallop.  Was this sodium fiasco my fault?  I asked for more bread to counteract the over-seasoned saltiness of it all.  Alas, my efforts were in vain.  It was just too salty.  I went through 2 glasses of water and 2 dinner rolls.  My server apologized and asked if there was something else I would like instead, but by then I was too full from the water and bread that I just asked for dessert.My server came back with the menu and as an apology, she said dessert was on the house.  Horray!  I wanted something nice, so I asked her what the prettiest dessert was (I'm a sucker for plating).  She suggested the apple pie, whoopie pies, and since she was a chocolate lover, the chocolate cake called \Heaven Can Wait.\  Wow, really?  I'll have that. The chocolate cake was simple but decadent, drenched a rich ganache and.. a sea salt chocolate stick? C'mon, what's with the salt?!  Nonetheless, I still throughly enjoyed the chocolate... it was the perfect amount of sweetness to balance the salt.All in all, I expected more than what I got.  One pleasant at the end of my meal was the free cotton candy with my check... one not so pleasant surprise was the $1 charge for the distilled water I was served.  Great staff, very friendly, but I'll come back just for the soup.",Ns2Zsf5G,110

The restaurant has a chic but casual feel, and the entire staff was super friendly from the get-go. The highlight was definitely the sushi. We've been accustomed to the overly fried and overly saucy sushi from over-hyped places like Ra and Sushi 101. The sushi at Shimogamo was made with fresher ingredients and was simply delicious in its own right (e.g. not drenched in sauce to cover just OK sushi). We can't wait to come back for happy hour!

1161,3.6,"The other half and I settled on this place the other nite b/c we couldn't find the other Chinese buffet we were searching for.  After about an hour's drive, we looped back toward CenPho and pulled in here instead.  I had a bit of trepidation but you know I love me some ghetto Chinese buffet.  We'll, that's exactly what I got.The selection was pretty good but there were only about 10 things I ventured to try. The fried rice was skank; bland, tasteless and mealy. The \lo mein\ was actually the best thing on the buffet.  The chicken dishes were ok.  The pork spareribs were disgusting; mushy candy-red chunks of bone with hardly any meat, swimming in a gelatinous sea of sauce that tasted of only 1 thing I can compare the flavor to -- pink urinal cakes.  There was some nasty looking fried fish remains left dying on the buffet (the skin had been crackling under the lights for hours) and some assorted old food.  No egg rolls. Nasty dried out rangoon. The tables were sticky (which grosses me out completely) and the bathrooms were actually better than I expected given the rest of the place.I think if we'd come earlier the offerings may have been more appealing.  We hit the place around 8:30 on a Saturday nite and they closed at 10, so they weren't refilling the tables much. Such is life in buffettown.On a positive note, the fountain Coke was the best I've tasted in years -- perfect balance of sweet Cokey syrup and enough carbonation to not seem flat.I doubt I'd go in again, although the register receipt did crack us up.  At the top it reads, \Great Dragon Buffet presents the THANK YOU\. Well, thank you GDB!",OVZoiMVA,4900

I noticed they've added braised white beans as a side option which is intriguing; can't wait to try them!  The service is always ridiculously fast; which is a plus for a 'fast/casual' type place. The chocolate sheet cake is super yummy and reminds me of the cakes my grandma used to make.  You always get bonus points for reminding me of my grandmother. :)",q1Iq3AQT,1489

1165,2,My husband and I both love this place!  I've had the Delux burger and the standard burger.  To be honest I didn't really like the Delux burger.  I think serving a burger on a baguette is a bad choice. It was hard to eat and I thought it had a funny taste from the combination of cheeses and caramelized onions.  I also didn't like that they cut it in half.  The standard burger is a whole different story.  It is fantastic!  The quality of meat they use can't be beat.  I don't even order cheese on my burgers.  The meat itself is so flavorful it doesn't need anything else on it.  Every time we've ordered there our burgers always comes out at the perfect temperature.  I order medium rare and my husband orders medium well.  Usually when we order burgers at other restaurants   both of our burgers come out medium because the kitchen can't get the timing down for the two different temps,USWUbvZI,3858

First off, the location isn't real great, it's located next to a junkyard practically and it's along an unattractive stretch of highway with not really any scenic views in sight. Secondly, it can get crowded and it's pain to walk around it sometimes and stores are often located far from one another. Also, the stores here are stores you'd find anyway else basically and the same stores here have better locations in other shopping complexes. Lastly, it's a pain to park and drive around Tempe Marketplace's complex.

There was no one in the restaurant and a full staff. After washing my hands, sitting down at a table, reading the news on my iPhone, watching a couple come n and order and get served, I realized that no one had an idea what the hell I was doing there or that I had ordered and paid. I asked, at first politely, and they all looked up with the stare I most hate signaling, \ Huh? What? Where? They went thataway . I have not a thought in my head.\ Then they went into a mode scrambling to find the order. ( Tough because there were 3 people in the restaurant and I was the only one who did not get ANYTHING!)

After a week their response was that they cannot judge from the pictures and that there must be something wrong with the surrounding???  Horrible customer service after you buy the mattress. And the latex does not seem to be of the same quality as some other companies. I am still waiting to hear their response and whether they will send a replacement pillow.,vrF3YY01,4958

1189,2.8,"New Yorkers always think their city is the greatest city on Earth... Last week I was in Philadelphia and had a conversation with a guy from New York who went on and on about how New York is the perfect city and everything was planned perfectly,, yada yada yada.  I kept saying \yep, yep\ .... Whatever.   I gotta admit though, their pizza is the best. New York just knows how to do pizza right.  Chicago pizza is garbage, that thick crust sits in the bottom of my gut and I can usually only get one or two pieces down.So I went to Grimaldi's last week because I had seen the owner on the food network talking about how the secret to good pizza is in the water and Grimaldi's has the water they use to make the dough altered in a lab to match the hardness of the water in New York City. I thought to myself, this guy takes pizza seriously and in Arizona  good pizza is hard to find.  There are a lot of chains, and most of the mom and pop places just aren't up to par.   Grimaldi's pizza was awesome! I think it's the combination of cooking it in a coal brink oven, using real mozzarella cheese, and real tomatoes for the sauce.  The crust is fantastic; very light and thin.  The cheese is clearly fresh and delicious, and the tomato sauce was very mild, not too sweet, but not bland by any means.  I ordered a large pie with pepperoni and extra basil...  magnificent!  The pepperoni slices were small and slightly crispy around the edges, the basil was fresh... overall the pizza was just awesome.   I will go back for another pie.  Just a sidenote, the bar has a nice selection of beer a spirits.. just a another plus about Grimaldi's.  I would definitely recommend Grimaldi's to anyone looking for good pizza.",jfJZ1lpk,2518

I know Vietnamese food is not Thai; I know the food is not spicy.  I also know the flavors that should be in Vietnamese food, even \Americanized\ Vietnamese.

The server was pretty quick and he gave refills without being asked.  Chips and salsa were good.  Chips were warm and salsa had a nice (suprising) kick.  Kick... do I sound like an old lady?

Fish was ok... nothing spectacular... but honestly I would rather pay for one at freakin Del Taco or Rubios.  Not worth it here.  Rice was ok, some flavor, probably converted rice though.  Beans were... blended?  I dunno about you but I like to see some actual BEANS in my beans!  This stuff was like brown goo... YUMMMMMMMM... :PThe beef taco was just weird.  I swear to God is tasted like gyro meat!  WTF?  I couldn't eat much of it.  Last but not least, Dom ordered the White Sands Chimichanga.  That sh*t looked nasty to be honest.  Covered with some gooey white sauce, filled with pork.  LOL, he said it tasted like hot dog.  Um, yikes!  He took about 2 bites and was \full\.  A.K.A., he didn't like it.I also had a margarita... it was HUGE and didn't taste very good.  I'd rather have one 1/4 that size that tasted nice.  Oh well.One star for the chips and salsa.

1205,2.8,"Don't let the vinyl banner sign in the abandoned-looking strip mall fool you.  Lulu's Cupcakes is one hip, modern bakery.  The cupcakery is much larger than it looks from the outside, with a long, L-shaped counter at the far end.  Lulu's menu is suspended above the counter, describing the flavors of the cupcakes perched on covered glass cake trays below.  Next to the entrance is a high counter with a handful of bar stools, and a couple of small two-person tables are lined against one of the longer walls.  Modern lighting fixtures hang from the ceiling above all of the seating areas.  The other long wall houses a display case full of all sorts of baking-related accessories and knick-knacks, as well as some totally random stuff.  A pair of large armchairs and a coffee table are located in the center of the store.  In general, the space in Lulu's seems largely empty and underutilized.  I'm guessing they're still pretty new.My selection at Lulu's included the Tantrum Tamer (vanilla cake with chocolate buttercream) and the Bunny Boo (carrot cake with cream cheese buttercream).Tantrum Tamer:  The vanilla cake was extremely dry and had a sharp, alcoholic flavor.  The flavor had the metallic tang that usually accompanies the use of too much vanilla extract, except that I didn't really taste any vanilla -- just alcohol.  Eventually, a sweet, buttery flavor with a subtle vanilla aftertaste became noticeable underneath the sharp alcoholic bite.  The chocolate buttercream was thick and fudgy with a nice, rich dark chocolate flavor.  However, it had a fairly bitter aftertaste and a heavy, greasy feel to it.Bunny Boo:  The carrot cake was dry and kind of bland.  It had a salty muted carrot cake flavor -- the spices didn't really \pop\.  The cake was kind of rough and when combined with the shredded carrot and nuts it made for a chewy, crunchy texture.  The cream cheese buttercream was exactly that -- a light, sweet buttery frosting with a cool, refreshing cream cheese flavor.  Yum!  The cream cheese added some moisture and sweetness to the cake, but somehow the cake's saltiness and greasiness seeped through.  I really, really liked the frosting, but the sub-par cake just ruined it.  It's a crying shame because this was a truly fantastic frosting.At the end of the day, though I loved the super cute bakery, $2.95 was just way too much money given the quality of these cupcakes.",9is3UeVX,1683

1209,1.4,"Went once for lunch a long time ago and thought, \eh,\ but I've been there twice recently for their Sunday night four-course theme dinners and highly recommend them. I think Cork is the best fine dining destination in the East Valley besides Kai (which is one of the two best restaurants in the entire metro area, IMO).First dinner was in late Nov. for French night, and most recently was this past Sunday for German night. It was not what you'd call \authentic\ cuisine of these nations, but rather a lighter, gourmet take on some of the traditional dishes. For example, the French onion soup had a really light broth, not anything like the rich, heady, beefy broth you find in the bistros in France. But that is not a bad thing! When you're chowing down four courses, it is nice to be full, but not feel like you're going to burst at the end.The only letdown was that the sauce on the wienerschnitzel was massively over-salted. One other person in our party mentioned it first, and I had been thinking the same thing. But that's a minor detail given the value of these dinners. I would just ask that whoever makes the sauce bear that in mind for next time.Cost is $35, plus $15 if you want wine pairings with the first three courses.

In fact, MY carnitas is better. (I keep aiming for Chef Hector's at Sam's...) Yes, the pork was very tender, but the salt was -shall I put it nicely?- aggressive. Sam Kinneson aggressive. The \tortilla\ was an inedible science experiment. Thick and doughy, and made even more appetizing by the charred side, it reminded me of the salt play dough we all made as kids, formed into a pancake.

(I, of course, removed the raw onions), but seriously, this thing was loaded with flavor! Lots of Feta cheese, kalamata olives, banana peppers and a very light but tasty dressing...WOW! Was perfect for a warm spring day in Arizona!  Now on to the pizza...Kosmic Karma! Karma is not a B...it is a party in your mouth.  A very simple pizza, red sauce, spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms, and the pies de resistance...the most beautiful swirl of pesto that encompasses all the flavors into one pie of perfection! Oh but wait!

Yeah..that's it! Seriously! So that was just the one visit!My most recent vist was just a couple of weeks ago after a hellacious week of learning and thinking...we just needed some time to unwind and Mellow Mushroom was the perfect spot for myself and a couple of girlfriends to relax and enjoy some mindless chatter and good food!  Upon suggestion of one of the girls, we started off with the garlic pretzels, which to my surprise and complete satisfaction...are made of...THE CRUST! *insert teenage Bieber fan squeee here* Yes folks, you read correctly...THE CRUST that is perfection in my book! Garlicy and doughy and crusty crust with a side of very tasty marinara dipping sauce! For like $3.50 you get 3 full size soft pretzels.  Not bad at all.  Then came the pizza! I am a creature of habit and ordered the Kosmic Karma.  I believe that what comes around goes around and I wanted to see that pesto swirl go around my pizza pie one more time! I wasn't let down either! It was another one of those moments where you end up making those \happy food\ noises while eating.  No shame! I noticed my two friends were doing the same!

In the next five minutes, I'm pretty sure that every employee came by to apologize to us and ask if there was anything that they could get for us.When our food did arrive is was steaming hot and delicious. The Chop & Chick was exactly as one would expect. Perfectly cooked over-easy eggs, no gooey whites, but plenty of liquid yolk with which to dip my home fries in. The pork chop was of average breakfast size, but cooked well and still nice and juicy.My companion's special scramble was so good that it made me question my undying love of the majikal animal (pork) and the hash browns were awesomely crispy (but begging to be covered in gravy ;-)As we ate, Matt came by and apologized again for losing our ticket and asked us to enjoy our breakfast on the house. It was so good that I kinda felt bad about taking them up on their offer, but I decided that I'd make it up to them by going out of my way for more early breakfasts there.So, was it a perfect breakfast experience?

The soups really caught my attention; however I did not order any. Tomato-based soup and the white shirt I was wearing are natural enemies. (No, I didn't get any cheese steak on me).I know they had desserts on the menu, but didn't try any. While I don't know if I would race back here again, I will consider it as a good place to go.",fmu3kV7p,1601
1243,1.5,"I am not a fan of the Republican party, the one thing that upset me the most was that they strongly support SB1070 and when they were considering Arizona for the 2012 Republican National Convention they decided to go elsewhere because of all the heat we were getting for our immigration policy.....so they themselves have boycotted us.  Yet they run this state and drag our economy further down.  We have lost over $140 million in hospitality over SB1070 and we all know that we charge a good size tax on our travelers and now that we lost all those conventions our tax burden will be passed onto us.  Thank you \Party of NO\.   Oh and I know the people have spoken in this last election.....all 36 and older people because only 25% of the 2008' 18-35 crowed showed up to vote this election which means that the people representing the future generation of Arizona will be DEAD before the future gets here!",QmoCEo47,726

I...was...NOT...disappointed!This has to be one of the best pizza's I've ever had. I got the 14\ deep dish, one item - Pepperoni. Though a little pricey at $18+ - I went to go pick it up, for that alone, I don't expect to pay too much - it was worth every bite.I have to say Uno's is still my favorite - though I heard it shut down here in AZ!! ARG! - this comes in a very, very close second. It's the crust that did it for me. I liked Vito's, but the buttery Uno's is just simply better. And it's definitely best for takeout or delivery as the entire dining room seems like it could fit in my car's trunk. HIGHLY recommended. Despite my situation on the price, I will be going here from now. Or make that, delivery.

He got a call, and seemed annoyed with whatever customer he was speaking with - rushing the person along because I happened to be standing there. At least he was both courteous to me and the person on the other end couldn't see him. Also, he gave me a free One-Liter of Mt. Dew I was not expecting. Cheers!Food Taste: 5, oh, excellent!Food Quality: 5, FRESH, wonderful. As if made in my own kitchen.Cleanliness: 3 - it wasn't necessarily dirty, but it wasn't the Ritz either.Friendly Staff: 5 - like I said, he was friendly with me, at least.Fast Busing: N/A, didn't eat in.Smoking Area: No, in case you just stand on the sidewalk outside. NO! not too close to the door. Duh.Would I Return?: Is the Pope Catholic? He is, still, isn't he?Would I Recommend?: Even to someone on a diet.And to who?: Anyone within earshot, or at least someone within the Metro Phoenix area.Additional Information: Check it.

Aside from their clever signage I noticed they have an extensive menu in which I will definitely have to try their food one day.

So I don't know what to say about service issues others have faced... if you are going for nighttime, it may be different.I'm giving 5 stars because we thought the food was extremely good, and frankly, cheap for what you get.  Therefore, outstanding value.  One of the better values we've discovered recently.We had a couple appetizers and two entrees (sandwiches).  The standout in my opinion was the steak sandwich, which was probably the best steak sandwich I've ever hard.  With perfectly cooked, juicy pieces of meat and a zesty Gorgonzola cheese.For desert, my wife had gelato, I had a cannelloni.  What made the cannelloni so good was it was stuffed \just in time\ so that the shell was super crisp and light, and the cream inside cold and good.  Perfection compared with most places, where the shell absorbs the moisture.I'll be back.  I do think it's more of a casual deli kind of feel, but in a really cool neat restaurant and for the price and the quality of food, I really felt that 5 stars was warranted, and I don't give out a ton of those.",7pCE7JuP,2513

Since they are called Cookiez on Mill I decided to have one of their specialty \Cookie Ice Cream sandwich.\ Good thing I only ordered half of a cookie because it comes in a pretty good size (with two scoops of ice cream). I ordered a chocolate chip cookie with Mint Chocolate Ice Cream. I believed they make their own cookies and ice creams. The ice cream is amazing good. The ice cream texture was creamy and smooth. You can totally taste the mint flavor and chocolate chunks in it. The cookie is nice and thin but I wish it was more soft and warm. It was little bit toward the chewy side and it is little hard for me to bite it through. Other then that I am pretty satisfies with the cookie sandwich.

1300,2.7,"During a visit to Scottsdale last month we joined the few, the proud, the happy diners who have had a chance to experience Cafe Monarch! (Apologies to the USMC for co-opting their recruiting slogan in the above.) This venture is truly a labor of love for chef / owner Christopher whose passion for his endeavor shows through in every detail, from the ambiance to the food to the service. Arriving a little early for our 6 pm reservations on a Thursday night, we had a chance to speak with a couple of Christopher's friends who had dropped by to see him and learned that he created the wondrous space of Cafe Monarch out of what was formerly a beauty salon. In fact, Christopher shared that earlier that week, and perhaps even earlier that day, he had been working to replace an interior door and make some other changes. A never ending \adventure\ of putting the stamp of character on Cafe Monarch. Normally we might start a review with a discussion of the food we enjoyed, but the Cafe Monarch experience is so much centric to the persona of the owner that it might be best to start there. Christopher is a charming man with a convivial style and it doesn't hurt that he is pretty darned delightful to look at as well! Plus, he is a talented chef and does all the menu planning, shopping and cooking. No assistants or sous chef here. (In discussion with him, we learned we can thank his mom for his great cooking skills...in that he needed to learn to cook for self preservation!) He is also an accomplished host who serves the meals and circulates during the evening to make certain that his guests, whether dining inside or outside, have what they need. On the evening we arrived, there was pecan wood burning in two outdoor free standing fireplaces, offering a wonderful aroma and which would provide warmth of temperature and ambiance both for those who arrived and elected to dine outside as the evening evolved. We chose to sit inside where we could soak up the eclectic charm of the restaurant and enjoy watching Christopher at his craft in the kitchen. A nice couple from Washington state came in and sat alongside us and in enjoying an evening of delightful conversation with them, we all marveled at Christopher \in action\. Our dinner that evening started with a salmon appetizer that included thick (poached?) nuggets of the flavorful fish served with a slice of grilled eggplant (unique combination and worked so well) along with a wonderfully flavorful fresh herb pesto, capers and a slice of good, grilled crostini. We all agreed it was so Delicious and the serving size so generous we could have stopped there and been happy. But there was more to come in a choice of two entree selections, one was slices of pork (loin?) served with a fresh mango salsa and citrus sauce and the other chicken paillard served on a bed of creamy polenta with cheese and surrounded by a lovely pool of tomato sauce. All of the seasonings were just right as was the temperature of the food at service. We finished the meal with a baked Bosc pear topped with wonderful warm chocolate sauce and puff pastry dusted with confectioners sugar. Ahhhhh.....yummmmm. As others have shared, there is no liquor license here, so you'll have a chance to bring your own bottle of wine (we love being able to do that and to be able to share it, as we could on this evening,with the couple next to us.) Bring cash as our understanding is Christopher does not take \plastic\. To plan for the cash, we'll share that our dinner that evening, that we think included a $10 fee for corkage, was $98 or so, including tax, for two people. On our next visit to Scottsdale, we hope to be able to have lunch at Cafe Monarch and sit outside to enjoy Christopher's hospitality and great food again. A closing note for this review is to mention accessibility. We have a heightened awareness of that issue of late and also note that the NY Times has included accessibility comments for some time in their reviews,with a renewed focus after food critic Frank Bruni had a favorite dining companion start to use a wheelchair. While Cafe Monarch is on one level, there is a step up to the restaurant, all inside seating is at \bar height\ chairs and the bathroom is not accessible for wheelchairs.

The portions were large... the \side order\ of fries would have been plenty for two people to share.My salad was filled with all my favorite stuff... crisp lettuce, tomato, olives, and feta surrounded by soft pita triangles.  The fries were swimming in feta and dressing... mmm, so good.  I'm looking forward to going back and stuffing myself on more fries!",9oxEbrhB,4882
1302,1.9,"Would you like a side of grease with your grease? Because that's what's served up here 24/7. Our hotel ended up being just two doors down from our hotel on Basline, so we ate here twice in one day. Once for breakfast and one late-night, farewell sesh to the WH. We stuck to the classics for breakfast, splitting a plain Belgian waffle and each having a bacon, egg & American cheese sandwich with a side of hash browns. You can get the browns a number of ways, but they're all served \scattered,\ pretty much meaning they're thrown on the grill. Then you can go \splattered\ (grilled onions), \peppered\ (jalapenos), \chunked\ (ham), \capped\ (mushrooms)... you get the idea. You can even get all the fixins if you're feeling macho.What would we order again and again if we had more than a few days in Arizona? Easily the Texas cheese melt--oohwhee, gooey cheesesteak and onions inside some bready Texas toast. Wash it down with their Iced Tea and pray to the Pepto Bismol gods for mercy.",xMzjfXaL,652

Aside from the token produce stand, the token honey stand and the token olive oil stand, this place really doesn't have a leg on which to stand. That's a shame. But, that's a college town. When I found out this farmer's market has been existing for about four weeks, I was truly disappointed in the turnout, because a dozen vendors do not a farmer's market make. While there is a great potential for this to be a great destination, I question whether or not Tempe--downtown Tempe at that--is an appropriate location for such a market. I'll keep my judgment to myself in the meantime and continue to shop here. At least there are alternative shops abroad.",tlQEi8L9,1664

Should have had the pizza I guess but the pasta caught our eye so I had the lasagna and my mom had the chicken parmagiana. AWFUL!!  The sauce tasted like it was tomato paste straight out of a can. There was very little mozzarella or ricotta cheese in my lasagna.  My sister had tortellini Alfredo and although the sauce was watery she liked it.  I would only go back to maybe try the pizza but it's unlikely. There are too many good Italian/pizza places nearer to my home.,BcmduAcr,1519
1323,3.7,"I get to visit Scottsdale once every 5 years or so on average.   And that is plenty for me but that's another story.   Some of the locals were raving about this place.   They told us the food was top notch and you will never find anything better.   Throwing caution to the wind, we decided to try this place.   Boy were we surprised.   You have to understand, this is a hole in the wall joint.   I usually like those places because they try harder to keep their customers coming back and the food is not pre-made.   I should have known things were going to be bad when we got into the restaurant and met the hostess.   She is a dwarf, or midget or what ever the difference is, I don't know.   Let's just use the PC term and say \Little Person\.    Well, we were not greeted by a smile, but just a look that said \What the hell are you staring at?\  Ok, I am not a jerk nor am I trying to be, I just made eye contact with her and told her to get us a table for 2.   This gal puts us in the enclosed patio which, while air conditioned, is where they seated two families with unruly kids between 3 and 8 years old.   (Watch for my upcoming review of Scottsdale later.)   Ok, so this hostess brings silverware, chips and menus at different times.  Each time she stopped by, we made eye contact, smiled and said thanks.   Still, we got the glare of death from this woman.   Ok, whatever, we tried to be nice.   So after that, any time she brought something over we barely even acknowledged her.  That seemed to work out the best.   The waitress was a little better, although she had a hard time talking over the little monsters in the room with us.   I found out if you want to drink your beer out of a glass rather than a can or bottle, you have to ASK for a glass.   Ok. Fine, I can adapt to that as well. By this time, I am thinking the food better be freakin' awesome.   Well, dear reader, you have seen the rating I gave it so you can figure it out for yourself.   My dining companion had a chicken mole dish and I had a beef chimichanga.    The mole sauce was way too smoky.   It didn't have any of the rich, smooth or savory flavors it's supposed to have.   It's almost like we were eating something that had been smoked over a hickory pit for a month.   Surprisingly, the chimmy wasn't bad at all.   The shredded beef was cooked and seasoned just right.   So, I have to give them high marks for that.   The standard rice and beans sides were very forgettable.   Hopefully you are not too hungry when you go there as the serving sizes are not that generous.   Will I go back?   No.   I will try most everywhere else in Scottsdale before returning there.",k62nQxih,4049

1337,1.3,"We have had so many problems with this restaurant through the years.  We would stop going for a while and then decide to try it again.  Yesterday was our last try.This restaurant consistently has a problem with food temperature.  Yesterday my teriyaki chicken, baked potato, broccoli entree was lukewarm at best and the broccoli soggy (they are very hit and miss with the vegetables).  I stopped the rude waitress as she was flying by if they had a microwave.  She said \yes.\  I asked her if she would take the plate and put it in the microwave for 30 seconds and she said \yes.\  Next thing I know, I see her serving another table and then going to the bar and doing some work there.  I go up to her and ask where my plate of food is.  Soon, I see a man (I later learn he is the manager and could not believe it because he seemed more like a guy with the deer in the headlights look than a manager!) bringing a whole new plate of food to the table (he says it wasn't but I had already cut my chicken and had a piece and this was a new piece.  So, get this - this plate of food is COLDER than the first one and this was the manager of the restaurant serving it!  He seemed confused and befuddled.  I asked to have the entree removed from our bill.If this was the first time we had experienced problems here, we probably would have considered going back.  Through the years since this restaurant has opened, though, we have encountered cold food, frequently bad service and, sometimes, no service at all.  There was one visit where we sat at our table after being seated for 10 minutes on a quiet Monday at lunchtime and no server ventured even near us and we got up and left before having even been greeted.  No one seemed to care whether we were there or not.",VqnFj2f5,1947
1338,1.7,"CityScape - oh how you haunt my dreams.I was genuinely scared the first time I tried to exit your parking structure. Having to go uphill at practically 90 degrees and pray no one is trying to walk in front of you as you arrive at the top of the ramp was like playing russian roulette with other peoples lives. After a few trips, the anticipation and build up of riding up the exit ramp has worn off, but the thought of pedestrians in limbo still comes to mind. Over on the north east end on street level you've got yogurtini and the new fuego cityscape nestled next to each other. And in the central east corridor 1 level up you've got Gold's Gym and Tilted Kilt. Walk across the street or take the walking bridge between the two area's and surrounding the fountain go back up more stairs and enter into Stand Up Live or Copper blues. Back to the east side street level on the other side of the big stairway you can find arrogant butcher.If you find yourself on the Washington side of the center at street level in the west building, you can find, wait sorry, its the west side of the building and you can find five guys burgers. If you haven't quite picked up on this, the shops all seem to be disconnected in a peculiar sort of way. Most shops are of good to high quality and they will all validate 3 hr parking in the garage below the center. If you end up here on an \event\ night, just tell the attendant that you're shopping and get validated at your restaurant or shop destination. Don't let them try to convince you that everyone is supposed to pay $10 - you can still grab a ticket from the machine and have it stamped. I'm not about to spend $10 to park in order to spend $6 on froyo at yogurtini. Recently, Ive been biking my way down here and there's spots to lock your bike up all around the center, near most shops on the outside of the center or atop the the stairs / elevators aimed into the dreaded garage. I have personally tried to pass as a pedestrian in front of the garage exit on my bike and walking on a few occasions and some of the cars either simply don't see you, aren't looking, or simply couldn't care less about the value of human life. CityScape - please do something cause that exit is dangerous. I'm surprised that no one has been hit yet - or maybe they have and we just haven't heard about it yet. After a review like that, you wonder how on earth they deserve 4 stars. Well I really like venturing to downtown Phoenix and CityScape is usually my destination because the collective cool of the combined shops and restaurants outweighs the fatal flaws of the design of this structure. Good luck to anyone trying to walk or ride a bike along Washington in front of that exit ramp and watch out for cars, because they generally aren't watching out for you.Happy shopping and don't forget to wear your helmet and body armor!",B2ethhEd,2833

This is your inner city ice arena, if there ever was one.Situated behind a Radio Shack and next to a Walmart, the AIA is in a busy parking lot.  When we were looking for the place, we almost ran into not one, but three scruffy looking guys.  The 9 year old who was with us said \ you'd better make sure to lock the car door when we park.\  And we did - twice.When we walked inside just after the session was supposed to start at 6:30, they were just starting to prep the ice for the session.  The Zamboni did not even come out until maybe 6:45.  So, they were a little behind.We checked in and gave them our Groupon, which we had purchased for four admissions and four skate rentals a couple months ago.  The girl working the register was friendly enough.  DH and I have our own hockey skates, so we only needed two pair (for DD and her friend).  We went to the counter to get the skates and the young girl who was supposed to  retrieve them (who also works at the snack bar) seemed very confused.  She said she organized the skates in the morning, but now they were all over the place.  They were all in their spaces, but she didn't even know where to begin looking.  She couldn't find the right size for the girls, so we made do with what she did find.  She seemed a little dazed and confused, if you know what I mean.When we finally did get onto the ice, we noticed it was not smooth at all.  The ice was bumpy and grooved... and just not the smooth ice I have skated on before.  Not that I am a pro or anything... I could barely stand up compared to others there.  Still, it is worth noting.It also bummed me out that when I pulled out my camera to take a picture of DD's brief two minutes on the ice, I must have dropped the 9 y/o $20 bill.  No one turned it in, so I felt horrible.  And, yes, I will be going to the atm in the morning to make the kid whole again.  But the kid and I decided that if someone would just scoop up someone else's money without turning it in... they probably needed it more than us.  Smart kid. Did we have fun?  Sure thing!  Would we come here again?  No way!  We will try Polar Ice in Chandler next.  At least then we'd be closer to our neck of the woods.  **The best part of the experience?

I know they are a busy place so I went a few minutes early to grab a table since my friend was driving from N Scottsdale.  The Hostess was friendly and told me it would be a 15 min wait for a table so I headed to the bar to grab a drink.  15 minutes pass and I see others that came in after me being seated.  20 minutes pass and I ask the hostess how much longer it would be.  She told me that she couldn't seat me because the rest of my party hadn't arrived yet.  I said yes I am waiting on 1 other person but I came early to get a table while she drove down.  The hostess told me they were busy and can't let people just hold tables all day for their friends.  She rudely said she would seat me now since I complained and lead me over to 2 lounge chairs with 2 wobbly end tables pushed together to make a table.  The idea was cute but made for an awkward eating experience since I was leaning forward and bending down to enjoy eating my lunch.  I had specifically asked for a table so I wasn't sure if we got seated at this table because I had complained as there were other more eating friendly tables available.The whole ordeal was very off putting so my friend and I stayed for a bit and then went to another restaurant,FYxc0pOA,992

1348,2,"A little kindness goes a long way, boys.  This review is for the 3 star lunch buffet and the 1 star service.  I have to admit that I am out and out soured for most Indian buffets in that my fave one in DC, Ragaa, makes me weep how good it is.  But one of my fellow Yelp buddies said this place made her belly happy, so I gave it a try. The smells and sight of the sparkling dining room made me thing that good things were coming my way.  As I perused the buffet, I noticed that it was really geared towards quantity rather than quality.  Tandoori chicken was way overcooked (and all dark meat - not a big deal, but it seems like they are saving the white meat for something else - maybe dinner?) and the other meat dishes were just so-so.  Saag paneer was tasty, as was the daal, but both forgettable.  And the rice!  It wasn't fluffy and light like you'd expect, but a little crunchy - a sin at an Indian restaurant as far as I'm concerned!  The only true delight is the warm, hot naan that they bring by to sop up the sauce on your plate.  I could make a meal of just it, except that $10 is a little steep.My true issue with the place is the sheer lack of kindness on the face of anyone that works there.  It's like they are pissed off that they have to serve you and want to be elsewhere.  Fine by me!  Go away and have someone else serve me that'll say \You're welcome!\ when I say \Thank you\ instead of scowling and walking away.  We actually got into an argument the first time I went there - we were a party of three, but a friend was coming so I asked for a table for four.  The friend never came, so we were surprised when they charged us for four buffets and then put up a fight when we asked to take the fourth charge off for a person that was never there.  Come on, man!  You served us bread and water our entire meal - you saw only the three of us.  Sad.I have to admit, I do return to this place when friends suggest it for lunch - like a drunken hookup, I fall into it and then ask myself what I am doing once I am there.

I love the fact that all of the water dispensers in each of the workout areas have fresh squeezed lemons to quench your thirst and cleanse your body.  When your finished with the workout retire to the steam room to relax and have a nice shave.

I honestly didn't shop around for a cheaper price here in Phoenix,WKpbbo2o,4960
1362,3.1,"I took my wife here for a mini date last Friday. She's a chocolate fiend so after reading the reviews I was hoping to impress her with this place. Well, she really appreciated the thought I put into it, but I think the chocolates weren't quite as astounding as everyone made them seem. Don't get me wrong, they were good - but I guess I was hoping for \oohs\ and \aaaaaaaaaws\ and other reactions better suited for the bedroom, as is the case when she is truly in ecstasy with her chocolate fantasy. We tried several: coconut, dark chocolate, a butter cream (YUM) and I think a coffee one? They were all really good, and I'm not a chocolate lover! The fillings were really creamy and sweet. She had an iced coffee of some sort and she liked it. I had iced tea, which was really really good, it didn't even need sugar! That's a lot coming from me! We also got a Leonida's Nibs chocolate bar, which she seemed to enjoy the next day. I'm sure she wouldn't refuse another trip here but they didn't knock her socks off the way I'd hoped. I think next time we'll share a dessert, they all looked amazing! We'll just be sure to skip dinner that night!",moXXLpsK,1907

I am accustomed to the unique and delicious meals created at Tru Food and expected something better due to the higher prices, but it was not delivered. The service and atmosphere were great, but the entree I ordered was something that would come out of the Applebees kitchen.  I ordered the trout which is something normally prepared very simply and although the ingredient list in the meal's description did have quite a few ingredients it was how they were put together that ruined the meal.  When the dish was brought to the table I thought, \this isn't mine\ because of how it looked.  Trout should be served very simply with no breading, gravy or anything else to cover the taste of the fish.  The people at the next table even commented on it.  I did bring this up to the server who also thought they overdo it on the trout.  My friend had another dish that was quite good.  I'll stick with Tru Food.",bbSlgEDd,1474
1373,4,"The Sugar Bowl is a Scottsdale tradition, a sort of ice cream parlor/dessert diner which, according to the Family Circus cartoons framed on the wall and the delicate pink chairs and plush pink round booths, is a place for daddy to take his little girl.

I may be more Amelia Bedelia/Mary Poppins in age than Jane and Michael Banks, but I still go crazy for ice cream, as well as beautifully illustrated 60s influenced napkins and late 50s influenced parlors.  The young dude that waited on my table was courteous and didn't respond to my super hard to read blandishment attempts (plus Scottsdale is stocked with titillating women to the average heterosexual man) or mind that I was the only one getting something.  I tried the Mocha Chocolate shake which was rich, flavorful, and seemingly made with care or at least higher quality ice cream than the milk shake I'm used to.

Inside it looks like you are at someones wedding reception at a nice catering hall- nice, but unoriginal.  All of the staff were very kind and helpful and we soon got down to business. The salad bar was my garden of Eden! Mushrooms, beets, humongous asparagus spears (genetically altered, perhaps?;) ) the basil dressing? Amazing. I loved it, and even my veggie-shy man enjoyed some of it's offerings (bread and butter!). Time to get meaty! I have never had so much hot meat in front of me at one time! We quickly learned what we liked (filet and ny strip for me) and what we didn't (bottom sirloin still visits me in bad dreams). I tried two pieces of chicken that were both hard as rocks and a pork sasuage  that was ggggross! I had more uneaten meat on my plate than i had consumed, so after about 20 minutes I cut off the meat flow and went back for seconds at the salad garden.  Before leaving, we finally saw the lamb chops coming around. I love them and had to try them. My first bite was pretty decent. But each subsequent one was fattier than the next. Blech! Enough for me. I will mention the sides, although they were truthfully unmentionable. The \crispy polenta\ was overcooked and greasy, the plantains looked nasty but tasted ok. The potatoes were the best of the worst, and we actually ate them. But overall, the sides aren't worth the room in your belly. We had none left, and therefore passed on dessert.I'd go back for the salad bar, it alone costs $20, but I think it's worth it. Everything else, meh.",WaoS2DBf,4517

1385,3.9,"Pei Wei is always busy, that's gotta mean something right? Wrong. There are restaurants that serve billions yet all they serve is a gross mystery. Pei Wei is no mystery though, the food is cooked in an open air kitchen. Even so, if there were such a thing as Asian fast food, Pei Wei would be cleaner version of it.Most Pei Wei's are situated in pompous locations where ever there is an AJ Fine Foods, but atleast they aren't located in the ghetto.As far as the food goes, it is about as Americanized as you can get. So if you live in America and have American taste buds, it will appeal to you. Unfortunately if you want authentic Asian food you won't find it at Pei Wei. I don't understand why they even bother to put chopsticks on the table, the rice isn't even sticky enough to pick it up with. They are for decoration. They are part of the 'fake' Asian dining experience. Apparently, Pei Wei serves food \manadrian style\ from Thailand, Vietnam, Japan, Korea, and China. In the words of Bill Lumbergh, \Ooo.. yeahh.. I'm just not sure about that.\ Having traveled to China I can honestly tell you that Chinese food is different. Apart from the rice, the food lacks vegetable oil and garlic. In China those two ingrediants are used in many dishes and Pei Wei lacks them. When I first started visiting Pei Wei I ordered the Sweet and Sour, but I got sick of it. Sometimes the meat would be tough, sometimes the chicken would clump together all nastily. What I get now-a-days and what I got on this particular day was Mandarin Kung Pao. Even though the dish is spicy, that doesn't mean it has to be dry - and it was. What it was missing was some catalyst to bring out the spicy flavors and make them more vibrant.The dishes at Pei Wei are family style meaning they are meant to be shared with several people. A dish and a drink will end up costing you about $10. If each person gets one dish, that's a lot of food, probably enough to feed a small village in Africa somewhere. It would be nice if they served each dish in two styles, family and single, large and small. Family style is great if you always visit Pei Wei with your family. But if you are out for lunch with people from work you might not want to share your food with your co-workers. They aren't your family. You don't know them.Pei Wei is a modern Asian diner that is probably better than most of the mom and pop Asian diners out there, even if most of the food is cooked by Mexi-- I mean Asians.",mYJauU5x,4265

My order was lost or someone else claimed it. Whatever, I drank another beer and left hungry. The second visit was successful. The key is not to think too much when ordering.I had the gringo and jerk chicken. The meat, beans and rice were really fresh.  There is a lot of flavor here.

The menu was basic, but I guess they are trying to be great at one thing and not suck at everything. While ordering, the gal there ran thru a 20-word-per-millisecond schpeel that I'm sure she gives everyone, which I had to have her repeat. Prices could've been a little lower, and not wanting to bankrupt my paying friend, I opted to go with a water.The burger I ordered wasn't very hot when I got it, but the fries were legit.

1402,2.1,"Phoenix Pride has swollen in size and gets bigger every year. I first went in 2002, and most recently went in 2009. Typically most cities host Pride in June, though for obvious reasons Phoenix rings in the Pride season in early April. The selection in vendors and dining, and the volume of people attending grows every year. I got to Pride over an hour late (from the parade start time) and got to 3rd Street to see a significant number of floats still on the parade route, meaning the opening parade is over an hour long. One downside is the entrance line. I would recommend purchasing tickets in advance, as you will avoid waiting behind all the other procrastinators to buy tickets, and waiting again to get into the main festival. The whole event used to be only on a Saturday, but has since expanded to the whole weekend. A good majority of Steele Indian Park is filled with party-goers. I look forward to seeing it grow and develop more in the future, as Phoenix' gay population, who like most everyone else here is a transplant from elsewhere, forms stronger bonds and a stronger sense of \community,\ helping the city to coalesce into shared living space and culture.",3GoShFaw,1664

1414,2.5,"I'll have to echo the sentiment of Shannon B.  I went to PVOBGYN as a new patient because I wanted to chat with more doctors and get second/third opinions regarding my pap results & recommended course of treatment that I'd received from another health provider.  Specifically, I was seeking information on non-invasive and/or natural alternatives to a LEEP procedure, but wanted to speak to a few more MDs before going to a naturopath.  The office has all kinds of classy-looking dark wood paneling, high ceilings, nice carpet, LCD tvs, a coffee station, blah blah blah.  Whatever.  I go to a doctor for medical advice and treatment, not examples in interior design.  The lobby was also full of ads pushing baby formula and cord blood banking which I felt was odd given we know breastfeeding is healthiest for mom & baby, and that newborns receiving their own cord blood via delayed clamping is highly beneficial.  This issue is not specific to PVOBGYN but you'd think a classier place would have the sense to say no to these companies just trying to make a buck and increase their profit margins.  Oh wait, or maybe the office got a referral kickback and it was said pushing of services that paid for their nice interior decorations.  Who knows.  I found it in poor taste.Dr. Deka was recommended to me from a trusted friend, but as soon as she sat down and we started talking I felt like she wasn't listening to my concerns.  She would only default back to medical protocol and when I posed challenging questions she responded she \didn't really know.\  I was particularly interested in ways I can help my own body naturally fight off high-risk viral strains and promote healthy cell growth.  I told Dr. Deka that I was taking some supplements, adding more cruciferous vegetables to my diet, and increasing my consumption of raw juice from kale, carrots, beets etc - then I asked what more she recommend I do.  Her response was \Well maybe if you get the LEEP you won't need to juice so much.\  WHAT???  What kind of \health\ professional would ever recommend against doing something that has only been proven to improve one's well being??!?!?!   When I expressed concern over the likelihood of repeat LEEP procedures, since I have had recurring abnormalities since the age of 17 and am only in my 20s, Dr. Deka replied she \hadn't had any patients who had required a second procedure.\  Okay, well I'm going to take that with a grain of salt, being that she's only in her early 30s and earned her doctor of medicine in another state - highly unlikely she has any long term data from her own practice or has seen a patient for over 5 years.I'm not impressed with this place.

Then, after figuring out that it was probably a seat yourself type of place, we took a seat and waited for a waitress/waiter.  Most of the other tables had people looking over menus so we figured that a waitress/waiter took orders.  After a few minutes of sitting, we decided that we should probably go up to the counter and order.  Not that I had a problem with it, its just that it was very confusing.Anyway, here is the rundown of what we ordered and my rating of it. * spicy buffalo wings - they didn't look like it, but they did have the texture and flavor of real wings....kinda.  The sauce was good and spicy but was very very salty.  The \ranch\ was good too.  I would order this again.* artichoke gratine - very good and pretty spicy - I would order again* green burger - neither myself or my wife was a fan of this.* diablo red bowl - I actually thought this was good.  Aside from it being very very very very salty, the dish was very flavorful and had a nice kick to it.  I ordered it with mock beef which somehow had the texture and flavor of beef.All in all I thought this place was ok.  The staff is friendly, the food was ready quickly and the prices are reasonable.  My only real issue is with the food.  Since I don't have any issues eating meat, I would just assume go to a place that serves real meat.  This place goes through a lot of trouble to make food that tastes/looks/feels/smells like meat for a bunch of people that don't want to eat meat.  It is all very strange to me.Although I probably won't be back unless I develop a severe allergy to meat and dairy, I would recommend it to people who want to try something different.  You probably won't find a better place to try out the vegan lifestyle and truly appreciate your carnivorous ways.",kgm9cHCB,1845
1424,4.4,"The Beautiful Carin and I needed some new TV's for the new place at the beach.What...did you think we were just going to sit there and watch the ocean?No, we need our TiVo, our college football, our Hawaii 5-0 and our MadMen, just like everyone else.And we need them wirelessly in every room, with incredible sound and in 3D/HDTV!So it was time to re-up on the television front.It turns out that it's actually cheaper to buy the TV's and all the attendant crap here in Arizona (and have our mover take them along), than it is to buy them and have them delivered in California!I know, it seems crazy to me too, but when you are buying four of these bad boys at one time...well, the discount did not hurt my feelings, one iota!We dropped by this location after breakfast on Sunday...\just to look over our options\...but I'd already done my research, done a little online looking, dropped by Best Buy, Fry's and Costco and I knew what I wanted and about how much it was going to cost me.Imagine my surprise, when Chris, the nice sales guy ran the numbers for us and the total turned out to be about $1,000 less than I thought it was going to cost me!Delivery was right on time, everything showed up intact and as soon as the installers finish and we finish our move, I won't need to look outside for anything...ever again!The whole world will be available in 3D-HiDef...all 13 movies of currently available 3D content.In a final ice touch\, I had no sooner gotten off my plane today than my pocket rang (and vibrated...I do so enjoy my very smart phone)...it was Chris calling to make sure that the delivery was smooth, and that I got everything I had purchased...going the extra mile!UE made it easier to part with my money...easier, not \easy\.",pJjrjAFg,1435

I suspect it is on the same lines as a restaurant with no pricing on the menu...I can't afford it.

Even more so now that they added the orth bar/lounge\ Went here today for lunch, the place was very busy but they managed to find us a table quickly. I ordered the Angus burger which was very good! The service was as well. The reason I love this place is because it's not defined as being a \happy hour\ spot or \lunch\ spot... North is a great spot for a quick drink, long lunch or an intimate dinner. It is a well rounded spot for any occasion and I have never been disappointed.",4gRFpGIF,3965
1429,3.4,"My husband and I went there tonight for the first time and loved it. There was a convention of some sort but once they moved into their hall the noise level dropped to a comfortable level.We were seated quickly and out of the way from the crowd of conventioners. Our server was Drake and he was great. He knew exactly when to tend to us and when to let us be. He was prompt in bringing us our complimentry bread that came with oil, butter and jalapeno jelly. They bread was nice and warm without being too hot. My husband had the 12oz Striploin and I had the 6oz Filet Mignon both ordered at medium rare. They were cooked perfectly. The asparagus was cooked just right and not over done. My only \compliant\ would be that the mashed potatoes could have been a bit warmer.Since it was a Friday night and they were having something called \Social Friday\ (or something like that) we got a free dessert when you bought 2 entrees. We chose the creme brulee. I loved the flavour of the caramel and coconut! Mmmmmm it was subtle but you could taste it. I would have given 5 stars if the dessert would have not been so thick. It was tasty but had the consistency of a mouse rather than creme brulee.The value was reasonable for what we got ($53 after taxes) and the entertainment book coupon made it even better (down to $32) and we will be back to use the lunch coupon and possibly the restaurant gc we have.",9Vkte4wi,1603

I went last night for the first time and wished that it was in midtown so I could drink there regularly.  Salty bartender who sings from behind the bar and sassy guitarist/singer up on the stage were both great.  The pour was strong and reasonably priced.  I think if I got too drunk I would be pretty tempted to start pulling dollars off the wall and tipping with them.  The place is pretty small though but It kind of lends itself to making new friends and getting a loud and rowdy.,TFXbBr9H,600
1433,2.9,"The food was meh at best, the service was deplorable. I ordered the chicken fried steak breakfast. First the biscuits came out when they served my fianc\u00e9 his dinner. Then came the steak and part of the eggs. The remain egg and hash browns came out. By the time I was served my fianc\u00e9 was nearly finished.  Our waitress left us sitting there long after we had finished eating. When I asked for a to go box, she took my plate and didn't return for quite a while. When she came back she asked if I wanted a box for my biscuits. I asked where the rest of my meal was and could see immediately on her face she had thrown it away. She then said \I thought you only wanted a box for the biscuits.\ which made no sense. She then left hurriedly and said she would adjust the bill but I would have gladly paid the extra $6 to leave. Both she and the manager said that they hadn't scheduled a cook and 2 waiters. The waitress said she was triple booked at her station.  I don't see this as the waitresses issue, but it seemed more like a lot of bad management decisions. What kind of manager has an all you can eat fish fry on a Friday night, and doesn't have all of his staff working? This was our fist and last visit to BBD.",cNTaHTdx,616
1434,2.5,"Came here for the \final meal\ with the now ex. before we parted ways. Food was fine. LOVE their french fries. It was a mini Chili's, nothing was less than expected..except for the personality of our server..It was like he used to work at a real Chili's then did something wrong and was banished here. He went through the motions but seemed like he was contemplating suicide. Not rude, or anything of that nature, just miserable. It was almost laughable.",ccy60rAn,4820

Well, that's not a cut. So she asked her manager, who also replied \Angus\. Wrong again. I expect an upscale, artisanal burger shop to know this kind of information. The fries and burgers were only average. I liked that their soda fountain dispenses real sugar Jones products. If you're looking for a great burger, I'd recommend SmashBurger then The Habit, in that order.",bHcS2IY6,753

1437,1.9,I did not know I could still be creative since it had been years since I had done anything that involves even a minor level of creativity.But what fun was this!A girl friend took initiative here to organize a kitchen tea on a recent Saturday afternoon. We were a table of 6 girl friends that were scheduled for some pottery making! My initial idea of this venue was admittedly a little different but better than expected in so many ways!For one we did not have to get all that dirty. Not dirty at all really. Also not that I mind dirty. This is for those who wonder whether to go or not to go.And two - we were able to bring along our own food and drinks which made for excellent responsibility sharing in the wining and dining arena.Once we were set up with our party arrangements and have had some snacks and champagne we were inspired to start our artistic journey. The idea was to have each of the 6 friends make a dinner plate (or item of the bride to be's choice) which we will then give to her as a wedding present. I thought this idea was really original.So the bride to be selected her dinner plates of choice after which we were briefed by a very friendly and sweet staff member as to the different effects that the paint will have once the plates were baked. All informed we went to select the different colors we needed for our different art works.Everybody started painting and each one of us got really involved with their own creation. The event took us much longer than we anticipated but in such a good way. We finished about 4 hours after starting off but much enlightened by the activity.Everybody agreed that we will have to go here again for the sheer enjoyment and good feeling of togetherness it promoted. I have not yet seen the end product as one of our friends went to pick up our designs - but we will presenting our collective gift to the bride to be soon :)Go go here for a stimulating outing with good friends/family/kids!,4hQXnhja,4313

Being the tourist who likes to eat at places not offered from the home state, I dragged the BF in here.  The decor/atmosphere is pretty neat.  While standing in line to get a table for lunch, you might as well enjoy the fish tanks of real fish and amuse yourself with the gift shop.  I'd have to be honest, this is not a place for good eats--pretty average menu items with above average price tags.   Didn't need any kids to amuse since we humor ourselves.+ Can be fun to thrill the kiddos--thunder/lightning & \rain in a forest\ (hence the name) coupled with \animated\ animals- Overly priced average food",AuP2kDpi,1307

I was given a plastic cup with some hazelnut in it and instructed to go to the self-serve area and get my ice and coffee. You can guess what happened when i added the hot coffee to the ice.

My friend got the Southwest salad and she said it was one of the best salads she ever had. They do not overload it with things. I admit I have the same issues with American restaurants too. Way to much food. Here they seem to have the portions just right,  The staff were outstanding too. I would really like to go back and try some of the dishes I saw other people eating there.

1447,2,Cheap tools! I love this place since they carry things that most places don't.  I came here for some ramps to drive my quad onto my truck.  They had 4-5 sets to choose from.  The only complaint I would say is they get busy and they cant always get to everyone right away but it's probably because they pass the savings onto the customer by not having tons of employees.  The tools aren't craftsman so don't expect a lifetime warranty but I don't always need that kind of tool.  I hardly use tools!,ZPLQXkcw,998

Our service was excellent and that's saying something since one of my dining partners is a bit picky and not afraid to speak his mind. He's not the easiest to please and even he seemed happy with his experience. I ordered the acai mojito to start and it was pretty decent for a mojito.

1450,2.9,"I Love Lolo's Chicken and Waffles and you will too! Recently my fianc\u00e9 and I went to Lolo's. I had heard about Lolo's and Mrs. White's for years, but never took the time to go to the Phoenix locations. When this south Scottsdale location opened, I made it a point to go and try the food. The food is excellent or in my best Brooklyn accent \Forget about it\. But don't forget about it, the MAC-N-CHEESE is a most try. The chicken is FANTABULOUS, the COLLARD GREENS are on point and they serve Kool Aid. Yes I said Kool Aid. I must have had a gallon of GRAPE KOOL AID. Before this, the last time I had Kool Aid was 1968. This place is very popular, so you may have to wait for a table, but it is well worth it. This place is so popular that Sports, Music, Acting and Reality celebrities can be seen here regularly. When we were there we saw the rapper Biz Markie. He did the song \Just a Friend\ back in 1990.  The only down side - although the service was generally good, it gets so busy that at times the server may get distracted and may not come back to you as timely or often as you may like.

1452,4.7,"I was excited to try this place on our side of town as we've had takeout from another location and loved it. We came in and there was a wait for a two top. No biggie, we both got a glass of wine and waited just a short while before our table opened up. We sat down having had maybe 4 sips of our wine. We waited. And waited. We had our wine....But no menus. I joked that it was like Costa Rica and the slow service there. I was in a good mood and happy to sit down after a long day on my feet. Still with the waiting.No... STILL MORE with the waiting!Now it was not funny anymore and we were being completely ignored. I checked my clock and it was 7:57pm. Clearly not a closing time issue. I tried to assuage my companion by telling him how tired I used to get after a big rush and they were probably trying to catch their breath. Yeah... that argument only holds weight for so long before you realize you've still been sitting there with a glass of wine from the bar and NO MENUS OR ANY ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FROM ANYONE. Seriously the guy who seated us was really nice. Where was he?A girl came around and put place settings out at 4 tables. ALL AROUND US. Still. No service. Fuck. Are you kidding me? I was seriously patient. I know what working in the service industry is like. This is ridiculous. \If we finish our glasses of wine and no one has said a single word to us... we are leaving\. \But you are not allowed to chug your wine\. \Deal\.{{{insert witty conversation for 5 minutes}}}Alright. All done. We have not sped up our drinking. We were very fair and patient... up we go. And we left. Would you have done anything different?",cChSFF5C,4339

1454,1.2,"Found this place from restaurant.com - I would suggest printing a certificate because this a pricey place and you will want to try the antipasti and dessert !First, let me mention the one negative part of my experience.  We made an early reservation for 5:30 (the restaurant opens at 5:30).  When we arrived there was only one table seated in the whole place but we still had to wait 15 minutes for our table!  In the meantime the two girls manning the reservation table spent the time talking to each other. Luckily, the experience got better once we were seated. Drinks and bread came quickly and we started with the antipasti - we choose cheese variety, deli meats, olives, and fruit spread. It all sounds basic, but was so yummy and flavorful when it arrived. It was a meal in itself (5 stars for this portion)For dinner we ordered crab linguine, three other ordered the tuna special of the day, and the hubby ordered the steak.  He made the best choice, the other dishes were fair/good.  Nothing to scream about, but all edible enough so no complaints (3 stars here).Even though we were full we opted to share the \house special\ dessert of the gondola bowl. It's a cute creme brulee with fruit, sauce, and a chocolate gondola on top.  It is a large dish so I would suggest sharing.  As creme brulees go I would rate it above average because of the added sauce (3.5 to 4 stars)Overall I rated it 4 stars, even though I was considering 3, since the Hyatt is a beautiful pace, the waitstaff is super attentive as there is a dedicated waiter and bus boy for the table, and the meal comes with...drumroll.....a complimentary gondola ride!  There is a lake at the back of the property and they take you out for a 15-20 minute ride, including a singing gondolier!  What a great topper !!",773kCjay,4163

1464,4.8,"Written by my wife, Jenny Martin:At first glance, Thai Rama is a low-key establishment that has been able to pack the place on Friday night. Although the atmosphere is less than stylish by any standards, the yummy scent of Thai spices is inviting. My husband enjoyed a Thai beer, Sing-ha. I stepped out of my box and tried a Thai iced tea, which is a Thai blend of spiced tea with cream. Let's just say it wasn't \my cup of tea\ but I'm sure it would be good to someone else! The menu is comprehensive, but was missing one of my favorite starters-a simple salad with Thai peanut dressing. We opted for the Thai egg rolls on the menu. They were mediocre at best, as I usually enjoy a lighter spring roll type at Thai restaurants. I almost always chose a Pad Thai on date nights at Thai restaurants, but tonight I chose to enjoy a Shrimp and Pineapple Curry dish. When the server asked how I wanted it prepared, I said \very mild.\ I will admit I have an extreme sensitivity to anything spicy-strange that I like Thai food at all, I know. Usually, the words \very mild\ have my dish arrive at the table to my liking. Apparently, Thai Rama likes to kick things up a notch. My mouth was on fire! Overall, I would have to say I have had better. The sauce was very watery and not very flavorful, except for the spice. The shrimp was definitely very good. The yasmin rice was outstanding-sticky but not too sticky. My husband ordered a chicken curry. He was surprised to find that it came with shredded chicken as opposed to chunks. Because he said the word \spicy\ when ordering, his was SPICY to the max! He did enjoy his dish, although wished there was more of a soup-like consistency rather than the small amount of sauce base. As much as we love Thai food, we concluded that there are better places in the Valley for our favorite traditional dishes. The service was great, everyone was nice. Maybe we are just too picky!",0pf2AZfK,3154
1465,4.2,"A breakfast spot on Mill? Hurray! I was so excited when Sucker Punch Sally's opened, I work on Mill and there has not been a \hot\ breakfast spot within walking distance in years. By \hot\ I mean something other than donuts and bagels. I looked them up online and was confused when the website listed was for a bike shop.. Hmm ok so I can't order ahead. I walked over and placed an order to go. The staff was very friendly, and explained that the owner also owns a bike shop (old school choppers and such) in Scottsdale. They should have the website update soon yadayada.I ordered a Denver omelet with hashbrowns, walked back to work and opened up the box. I should mention that it was about 10am and I was starving. I would have ate just about anything at that point, or so I thought. I opened up my box and looked down in disgust. Before me was an undercooked omelet (see picture) so undercooked that there was a puddle of yolk/water in the box, and to go with it was a side of freezer burned, undercooked hash browns. The hash browns were browned on the top but raw and soggy underneath. I was so disappointed, I tried choking it down but my taste buds revolted and I had to throw it away. It's interesting  to see 5 star reviews for this place. Lower standards perhaps? Or maybe I just had a bad experience? I doubt that as  there have been 4 other people I work with that have been over there and all had bad experiences. 1 star for getting  the name right, after that breakfast I felt \Sucker Punched\.",6i4JF3C0,3658
1466,2.4,"We would have loved to experience this first annual Chandler BBQ event... however due to some piss poor planning we and hundreds of other people were left out in the cold (or should I say hot). See... this event was supposed to go from 10am-9pm on Saturday, but by 1:30pm when we arrived they announced via megaphone that no more tickets were being sold and they were apparently \out of meat\. Please tell me how an event which is supposed to go all day until 9pm blows it load just three hours into the festivities? To make matters worse, when we were turned away they explained that they'd be re-opening ticket sales at 4pm and more food would be available. So we planned our whole afternoon around this, and wasted time until 4. When we arrived for our second attempt of the day, to our shigrin they changed their minds yet again and reneged on what they had said earlier. Now... tickets were on sale for five bucks... but there was no BBQ!!!! No BBQ at a BBQ Fest... ex-fucking-scuse me? Basically five bucks to walk around and stare at a bunch of empty BBQ reminants... it just didn't make much sense.So many people drove across town to come here (including us) and I really hope next time they put some more time into the planning of this event... it has promise. Hopefully we'll be able to return next year and actually be able to review the food... and not the ill planned event itself. Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.",xLaU1pAf,2629

1472,4.6,"Tempe Butte is a nice cross between a hike, a walk, and a climb. The whole thing isn't very long - maybe about 15 minutes, depending on how fit you are (I'm not very fit). Some people run up it, and I applaud their athletic ability, but I prefer to walk up very slowly.As far as I know, there are three entrances to the trail to get to the top. One is right by the old mill building and that starts off as a steep paved incline. The other two are on both sides of the light rail station behind the Tempe Transportation Center. One of those is right next to the Sun Devil Stadium. Those two entrances start off with an unpaved trail that winds upwards. It's slightly more interesting than the entrance by the mill because you get to see old signs on rocks made by the Native Americans that used to leave in Tempe. The trail ends up at the paved incline as well.After walking up the paved incline, you begin to climb the steps and rocks. This area is pretty gravel-y and I found it easy to trip if I wasn't careful. Some of the steps were pretty tall and took some effort getting up to, but if I can do it, most other people can as well. After passing by the \A,\ there's still a little ways to go before the top. Before you get to the top, there are a couple view points with benches that you can comfortably rest at. The top is nothing but some antennas and rocks. The rocks are interesting to climb around and sit on, but not as comfortable as benches. From the top, you can see Tempe Town Lake, the entire campus of ASU, and the Phoenix airport, too. We didn't wait for the sunset, but it also seemed like a pretty good place to watch the sunrise/sunset. Overall, it was a pretty easy hike, a nice way to spend a Sunday afternoon. I saw girls doing it in high heels and old ladies climbing it, too, so it's not that bad. I imagine it's also a pretty good workout for people who live in the area. For me, though, I think once enough.",7ESrskJY,3565

1474,1.8,Just left Zinburger for the millionth time and it never gets old. Nate used to always be our server but now he's the manager. Congrats to Nate and Zinburger for making awesome burgers and having great service. Make sure you ask what the featured burger is because it doesn't appear on the menu. Today it was a diablo burger and it was awesome. A mix of chipotle sauce with jalape\u00f1o and caramalized onions took my tongue on a spicy roller coaster ride. Pair it with a Sangiovese and you're in heaven.,KtOxdT69,3316

1476,4,I really like lunch here. The prices are reasonable and the menu is varied enough to pique my critical interest. I had a seasonal salad with local grown varietal tomatoes,rLOyIfzQ,232
1477,3.7,"Eh- it was just ok. I was told about the must-have Cajun fries, and they were just ok. Not spicy at all and appeared to be just like Cajun season salt sprinkled on regular fries. The fries were Kinda soggy and very greasy. Burger was ok. Tasted fresh, but I didn't know a \regular\ burger was 2 patties. Yuck. Sadly- my favorite thing about this place was the fact they had Mello Yello. Sweet. It's good enough to eat- but it's no where near the quality of Chuckbox which is right up the street. Shoot- fatburger a stones throw away is better. Its good enough to eat again if your friends wanna go, but its not a place that i'll be craving or want to search for parking to eat at.Oh well.",tnWL9WQ1,3342
1478,4,"I had to take some clients out for dinner yesterday and asked my wife for some eatery ideas.  She suggested this place which I never heard of and I must admit I jumped to some negative conclusions.  I expected to find a pretentious, small portioned, over priced cafe next to the \Scottsdale Ditch\ (sorry I meant to say Riverfront) where the seen and want to be seen hang.  When we showed up not a lot of big surprises.There is parking for about a dozen cars on the cul du sac for all of the shops but never fear there is the trusty valet who has already coned most of them off  (is that even legal?) and will happily park your car for six bucks a throw.  Sorry, I digress.  It's just one of my pet peaves.To be fair the restaurant decour was a pleasant surprise.  Very contemporary; open room, high ceiling with an outside patio next to the ditch... uh river.  The restaurant was about half full which was a departure from most of the others in the area which were empty.  I mean like not one party inside!  We were seated in a back room with floor to ceiling window views looking out on the patio and river.  Now you can't exactly see the river from the restaurant cause they planted bushes on the edge of the patio.  I'm paying a premium for a water front experience... where's my water?I read about lousy service here but ours was OK.  They kind of figured we were here to spend corporate money on a big party so they were  tip motivated.  The general impression from around the table was that the food was excellent, portions were ok, prices kind of high but what do you expect in that area?  The wine list is extensive and pricey and the sommelier is well schooled in spending your money.  With my thirsty crew I was looking in the two figure column and he was making three figure suggestions.  Ouch!Bottom line.  I would return to Olive & Ivy but maybe in the fall so I can sit on the patio and get a peek at the beautiful Scottsdale river.",KGjv2BTq,2748
1479,4,Quaint little house-style decor with beautiful patio seating...and what a wonderful time of the year to sit outside and enjoy the Arizona fall temperatures. We started  with the crab dip which our Baltimore native friends agreed was very good. They also ordered the crab cakes which were about as close as they'd had to the original back east.My husband got the pasta with green chile sauce. I think he was a little disappointed it was only pasta...and sauce. I thought it would have had more kick than it did with the green chiles. He also got the New England clam chowder which blasphemously had bacon in it. Not only do we not eat meat (so we had to send it back) I'm a native New Englander and authentic clam chowder does not contain bacon. Boooo.I think I enjoyed my dish the best-the barramundi served with asparagus,0NKiuHzH,1771

1482,2.9,Terrific restaurant all the way around.  The food is amazing and our service was completely top notch.  We went with a large group for a Saturday lunch and they generously gave us our own room with clearly one of their best servers.  We were made to feel right at home and had a wonderful time.  I followed others recommendations and had the pork nachos and ordered the Fuego Pasta with shrimp for my wife. Both were delicious.  The only negative was listening to my wife give me a had time for actually finishing the huge plate of nacho.  I think the chips were homemade as they were light,2jbdegfd,314
1483,1.9,"I've been through here a number of times but never purchased anything until this week. Mary M. compared this to Last Chance and she's right: it's more often than not overpriced clearance stock that I've found less than interesting. Items are overall in better condition than Last Chance's, but it's probably because there isn't much reason to go on a rack rampage in Dillard's. You won't find deeply discounted Coach, Badgley Mischka, or other high-quality fashion gems in this store as you would at Last Chance.Now to Jacob F's perfect summary: \Their amazing prices are instantly countered by despairing customer service.\ There was an additional 40% off some departments, which was the only reason I got to the checkout line this trip.I approached, the CSR was engrossed in conversation with the security guard (mall or store, I don't know which) and barley noticed my friend and I approach the register. I said \Hello, how are you?\ to get his attention and assistance. The CSR said nothing. Continued his conversation with the guard and did not once make eye contact with me. Took my items with his head permanently cocked to the other mall employee and rang me up. Muttered for me to swipe my card again due to a faulty read, and that was the only thing he said even remotely focused in my direction. My friend even turned to me and asked if we were standing there, remarking on the shoddy service aloud.When I took my items, I said, \I'm really sorry to have bothered you by interrupting your conversation\ and proceeded to walk away.The CSR muttered some indecipherable disparaging comments with the guard and I turned back and said, \Excuse me?\ To which the guard responded, \We did NOTHING.\\You're right,\ I retorted. \Which is the problem.\The CSR did nothing in the way of customer service, and the guard...I wonder how effective he is in ensuring some semblance of \security\ when far more focused on standing around doing nothing but gossiping. I've gotten better service at Goodwill and McDonald's, and called Dillard's management to tell them as much.",GP0od7Gy,113

1485,1.5,Friday night my wife and I found ourselves wondering what we would like to have when I suggested trying Fresh Wasabi.  I had been here once before and I had the teriyaki chicken dinner and a caterpillar roll.  I wasn't impressed with the caterpillar roll at the time because the Eal tasted a little fishy.  since they had just opened I figured I would come back another day to make a comprehensive review of things. Wednesday night my wife and I ordered an array of items.  We got a tootsie roll,X8e0Q2m7,814
1486,1.6,This place is really good and close to campus.  They moved in after Papa Johns closed and I heard from either a magazine or some sort of food magazine that said to stop in.   The thing about the Taco Shop is that they have really good Burritos and all sorts of great mexican delights that will fill you up and leave you satisfied.  There menu is diverse enough to give anyone something to munch on.It is a step up from Filibertos or Taco Bell and  is very different tasking then the Chipotle burrito.  This is where I must say if you have the craving of Chipotle your obviously going to go there,XHurtIbu,319

Sue me, but I love the stuff. Chose The Parlor for date night a few weeks ago after a brief chat about another favorite local spot that recently added valet (seriously, this is Phoenix) and had zero open spots for us to park our own car (novel concept). \Parlor it is.\   This vibe in this place is cool and unpretentious. Wait staff was friendly and service was good.  The modern d\u00e9cor is awesome. And, believe me with a boyfriend who has a career in visual merchandising, we talk about these things everywhere we go.   His eye kept noticing great little details like the wood plank ceiling in the bar and the stacked wood blocks making up the hostess stand.  Love it.  We sat in the bar and managed to snag a hightop table to ourselves among the community seating concept even though it was a Saturday night and BCS weekend!  The warm glow of the ovens, the low lighting and buzz of people had us wondering why we hadn't added The Parlor to our list of spots before.  Can't wait to get back to you, Parlor.

We went last night with a group of 8 and not a single person didn't enjoy their meals or drinks (get the boot!).The only thing keeping this from a 5-star rating is their extremely slow service... albeit with a smile.  The place wasn't packed by any stretch... but it took a LONG time to get ANYTHING (12 minutes for a drink,5NZPTlis,1078
1490,3.1,"Last weekend I was driving down Cactus when my brain said \PHOLICIOUS\.  I wondered where I grabbed the word from and glanced in my mirror just in time to see a sign that looked as though it could hold such a delightful word.  Since I hadn't heard anything about such a lovely place, however, I suspected that I was making it up and made a mental note to check my hallucination against reality the next time I drove by the intersection.I live less than a ten minute walk from the intersection, but every time I would head out, I would take a different route and \Pholicious!\ crossed my mind each time I was too far to go back.  Imagine my glee when I loaded Yelp two days later to see a review of this mystery restaurant that did, indeed, exist after all.  Pure joy.  Between classes today I finally had an excuse to dart by the house to give it a shot.The first thing that hit me upon entering the building was the scent of fresh basil.  I was immediately led to a seat and presented with a menu.  The decor is serene with blue and purple theme, almost reminiscent of a very mellow and chill Wild Thaiger.  During my hour visit, people were constantly in and out.  It was never busy, but definitely qualified as steady. With the first review in mind, I decided to give the crab and asparagus soup a shot.  The flavor was amazing and the price perfect.  My only complaint stems from my own ignorance: I didn't realize it was an eggy soup and due to my Major Texture Issues, I left too much of it in the bowl.Since my heart was already set on a cup of the crab and asparagus soup, I decided to forgo the namesake and give the crispy chicken and rice a shot.  This was also amazing and came with a little cup of chili oil on the side.  Next time I'll definitely try something new on the menu, but I was incredibly impressed by this dish.The service was a bit iffy.  They seemed well staffed and people hung around the register.  My server only appeared to seat me, take my order, and bring the food out.  I didn't receive any refills on my water and couldn't get anyones attention despite efforts.  At one point I considered walking up to the counter, but decided I'd rather remain tied to my food.I ordered steamed rice instead of fried, but received fried anyway.  I couldn't flag down anyone, ate a bit of the fried rice, and let it be since I was amazingly impressed with the quality of the food.  There are clearly some kinks in the system, still, but this place is incredibly new and I have faith that they'll work it out.  Anything this good should stick around and I'll probably be back before the week is out since the other diners' pho looked amazing.Actually, the service was the exact opposite of Khai Hoan.  There, they hover.  At Pholicious, they disappeared.After I finished my meal and waited slightly too long, a man came up and handed me the check.  I raved about the food and requested a take-out menu so I could have the formal name of these dishes and stash it away for my next Pho adventure.  He said that they had run out earlier in the day, but they would be available tomorrow.  I may have to return after work to pick one up.A solid 4.5 stars.  I have to borrow it for this one: \I like.\",gINzQFRZ,2849

They have a whole salsa bar that is fresh made.You walk in to a clean restaurant filled with mexican decor touched with a dash of beer signs.You can eat in or take out... again, it is a fast food place so you do have to deal with the kids and crap, but the restaurant can't help that.Love the slogan... where you don't \peso\ much.

1494,4.6,"I LOVE the idea of this place!  It is a very colorful interesting place.  The people that run it are poor business people and jerks.  The website should be your first clue.  When you read about how they cannot accommodate people with gmail - run.  Then the way you register is almost archaic in this day and age - send an email???After my free introductory class for my child where I felt absolutely unwanted - parents are NOT allowed to watch (WHAT??? How do I know what my child is learning so I can reinforce that in the kitchen at home???), the instructor was in a pissy mood (she actually said something to the effect of \if you older kids feel like this is too slow for you we have better classes, there are younger kids in here and I don't know why).  I sent an email to Chef Kathy to give her my feedback.  She defended everything that happened during our \introductory\ class.  If I didn't believe in the value of teaching kids to cook then I would NEVER return.  And this is the class that is supposed to be the hook to get you to buy a membership???Additionally, she uses groupon a lot.  The last groupon in april sold 2,111 spaces in the class.  It seems like they only have about  2 - 3 classes per day with about 10 students each.  That's only about 30 spaces per day, plus they have to accommodate their membership students.  So here it is the beginning of June and all of June's classes are still sold out.  Most of July's classes are sold out.  How are you ever supposed to get a space in this place at this rate???  Not to mention they are only getting about $5 for each of these students due to the price of the groupon so I wonder how much longer they can pay the bills.I think someone who actually enjoys teaching children, cooking, believes in good customer service and has a GOOD business sense should open their own YCA.  After all, it is a franchise and I would definitely go there and leave this one in the dust.I would also stay away from Chef Jo, I think she hates kids.",cWENMVqO,3945

No annoying punch cards or scan cards to carry around, no email/login/password, \registration,\ etc.  What a concept!  The seating area is small-ish but it wasn't crowded when I was there.  I appreciated the ample outlets along the wall for my laptop.  The only thing that bugged me about Press was the lighting, or lack thereof.  Personally I've never been a fan of keeping the lights off on a sunny day even when it's plenty light enough to see, read, etc.  It seemed like the only light was the natural light from outside, which gave the place a kind of gloomy, headachey feel (in this Yelper's humble opinion!).

Their \happy hour\ menu which is served all day is really just their \lunch menu,\ but a great selection nonetheless. I had the Panino Caprese ($9.50) which was more bread than mozzarella, prosciutto cotto, basil or tomato. A disapointment since the mozzarella and prosciutto on the Chef's Board were delicious. Plus it was very greasy. My colleagues had the Risotto with Artichokes ($9.50) and the Rigatoni al Ragu ($7.50) which they both really enjoyed. Service was top notch and decor was very inviting.

1522,2.5,"Neiman Marcus has the merchandise; there is no denying that fact.  All I can really say about the Scottsdale Fashion Square Neiman Marcus is consistently WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE of any retail establishment I have ever tried to shop at.  For the past 16 years, I have lost count of how many times I have been ignored, rudely treated, or had to suffer through a salesperson's condescending attitude, all while spending my money.  I recently mentioned this to my husband, and he responded, \Just walk in wearing scrubs and they trip over each other trying to help you.\  I laughed, because my physician husband only goes to NM to buy me a gift with a list in his hand.  If only those stupid salespeople knew whom they were disrespecting...they might jump off their high horses and help the wife of the scrub wearer.

I have people for that. First off I must say for bong sake you have the longest restaurant name evah! Secondly I must say your pork tacos really hit the spot.

1533,3.5,"I hate to admit it, but it had been a long while since my last visit to Roka Akor. I deserve a hand slap. But last week, I had the perfect excuse to pay a long overdue visit during Yelp Eats Week! We went on Friday night and to make a long story short, this is the perfect date spot and the perfect restaurant for delectable dining. But let me dive into details a bit more. First of all, the atmosphere here is vibrant and alive, but it lacks the \so Scottsdale\ vibe that some similar spots may have. For this reason alone, I will become a regular at Roka Akor. There's plenty of seating inside, including seats at the bar, romantic couch seating in the lounge, front row sushi seating at the sushi bar and then plenty of normal dining all around. We sat at a normal dinner table and took in the fun environment surrounding us. The staff here is incredibly friendly and attentive. We arrived on time for our 8:30 dinner reservation and were seated promptly upon arrival. The server welcomed us immediately and gave a descriptive overview of the food and serving style they suggest for the restaurant. Since we were there for Yelp Eats, I definitely wanted to take advantage of some of the Yelp Eats musts, so we ordered the Grilled Sweet Corn (Roka Akor signature dish), the Skirt Steak and the Warm Toffee Cake for dessert. But, that just didn't seem like enough, so added on the rock shrimp tempura and Kobe beef and Kimchi Dumplings -- two more Roka Akor signature dishes. Since there is so much delicacy to discuss, I'll break it down by dish. Grilled Sweet Corn -- as sweet as it sounds. I felt like I was in a scene out of the movie Big because the corn is petite and cut into halves, so I found myself nipping away on each tiny ear. The corn was grilled perfectly and had just the right amount of zing. *** PS -- probably not the food choice for a first or second date.Rock Shrimp Tempura -- by far my favorite dish of all and the top anywhere in the Valley. It's fried, it's tangy, it's spicy, it's crunchy, it's just delicious. I could eat an entire bowl (or two) just by myself. Kobe Beef Dumplings -- they were tasty and the perfect compliment to the meal. They were filling but not overly filling and with five to a plate, it's just the right amount for two. Skirt Steak -- I don't even know where to start. They give you a good amount of steak and it's perfectly tender, moist and delicious. We let them pick how it \should\ be prepared and that's the right move. It was medium well and the perfect amount of rare and well done at once. The marination on it provided the perfect sweetness and it was just the right amount of steak. It's a great dish to share as well. Finally, the Toffee Cake -- this is a great way to end the meal with a sweet touch. Delicate and delightful. I almost forget about the sake. The sake here is top notch and perfect for sipping. Accompany it with a Japanese beer to sip on as well and you're in for a great evening! Thanks for a wonderful Friday night Roka Akor. I can't wait to visit again!",AaBNmWml,4988
1534,3.9,"Well I wouldn't really call this place a \cocktail lounge\ like sayyyy Side Bar but to me it was more like a very well lit pool hall. Even though there was no smoking inside it was hekka smokey in this place. I am guessing this place is 21+ thats why people like it oh and cheap drinks!?!?! I'm not sure but this place KIND of reminds me of River City Pockets with less pool tables?? If this was like the only option available I'd go if you made me, cuz you cant fool me twice.

Oh, and poorly-designed restrooms (petty complaint, but still a pet peeve of mind). I'd like to come back... maybe during the day it will be less... uh...weird.

I suspect we may have been served by the same waitress that athan L.\ (in a previous review) was served by.

We've been eating at this location frequently (perhaps too frequently!) since it opened.Honestly, I don't think the food here is any fresher than In & Out Burger, but I like the selection of toppings (can you say, \fresh jalapenos!\) and the great selection of sodas.The peanuts are a nice touch to get you warmed up for the Main Event while you wait.I personally think it's a little over-the-top to decorate the place in nothing but rave reviews (WE GET IT ALREADY!!), but the cool music makes up for the lack of ambience.Since the Zagat announcement earlier this week, it's been mobbed.  Try to avoid peak hours, unless you want to wait for a table.Five Guys is definitely pricier than In & Out, but I think the selection of ingredients justifies the premium.3 tips:-Our family of 4 (2 adults, 2 kids under 10) can make do with one order of fries, though the orders have gotten smaller than when they first opened.-Ditto for the burgers.  Don't let the moniker \Little Cheeseburger\ fool you.  I got the regular burger...once.  But the \Little\ one is perfectly sufficient for me, especially after I load up on toppings.-Can't decide between the regular fries and the tasty Cajun fries?  Ask for a 'half-half' order and \POOF!\, you'll get it!Enjoy!UPDATE: Gotta drop 'em to 4 stars.  The last several visits, the fries have been soggy.

The venue itself, I think, has too many bizarre rules and they are pretty disorganized.Going to take a piss, I'd just bought a beer and, hey, I kinda like pissing with a beer.  It's fun!  Above the urinals they have these metal deals that are perfect for setting a drink on, in fact I can't think of a single other application in which they might come in handy.  As I walk in, this security dude goes, \Hey!  You can't bring your beer in there,\ and I'm like, \Well, I'm gonna set it down right here, then...\ when I came out, fuck, my beer was gone and so was the security dude.  Thanks, asshole, this place doesn't charge you up the ass for a drink or anything, anyway...Later on that night, the bar lost my friend's ATM card, and as she periodically checked the balance, she saw that at least one charge she wasn't present for at $2 went through.

It was a sweltering summer afternoon, I wasn't working, and I spied ice cream. I was dubious at the amount I was paying for a scoop of espresso, but I tried it out.HOLY.Since then, we've become ultimate fans. I know, duh, Food Network, countless local awards and 325 reviews, almost all glowing, can't be wrong. Brave the line--it's worth it.Flavors we've had:Espresso: Pure coffee flavor, with a chocolatey kick. Perfection. Buzzbuzz.Real Mint Chip: They ask you if you've had it before, because it's natural, real mint goodness and some fat 'murcans have a dumbed down palate. Refreshing amaze-mint. (Get it?!?!?!)Maple Pecan: Boyfriend's favorite. Chunks of pecans in sweet, sweet mapley goodness. He likes it more than he likes me. I bought a pint for him when he was sick and it immediately healed. True story.Pumpkin Spice: You don't need pie anymore, or a PSL from Starby's. Get thee to SR for this holiday TREATACULAR.Horchata: I know what you're thinking...well, maybe you're not thinking, because your brain just exploded in cinnamony goodness just trying to figure out how delicious this could be. Hint: it's BETTER THAN THAT.Brownie Swirl: Chocolate Explosion. Enough.I've also sampled a wide variety; the Earl Gray sticks out in my mind for being so unique.The waffle cones and bowls are made fresh and if you just want to throw all caloric issues aside, get 2 scoops in a bowl and call it a crisp-ity, crunch-ity day.

1551,2.3,Wow. What a difference. I came here last year and was disgusted. Being German and moving to the USA as an adult I know how German food should taste like and this was an embarrassed.

I will preface my review by stating that I'm not a \dessert person.\  I am a salt person.  And a liquor person. Fancy-schmancy desserts don't usually make me salivate, and it is never a challenge to pass on the dessert cart at a restaurant.  I wish I could tell you that this trait has been helpful to my waistband.  Alas, I use it as an excuse to pig out on whatever I have before dessert rolls around, and I'm no thinner than my friends who bury themselves in tiramisu or whatever. Okay, enough on that.I had the chance to sample two different cupcakes, and didn't get through all of either.  I preferred the Red Velvet with white frosting.For a cupcake so highly priced, I have several comments:1. Precious, adorable, perfectly crafted2. An absolute waste of packaging materials3. Ehhhh... cupcake was okay-to-good, totally huge, frosting was excellentWeighing all those things together, I'm a little baffled that people don't shut up about Sprinkles.  I certainly wouldn't be waiting in line on a hot Sunday afternoon to grab one.  However, if served to me again, I'll partake... if I'm not already busting out of my pants from whatever else I've eaten that day instead of sweets.",HctC9VYg,2463

I don't pretend to be a coffee snob but I am an addict and this place makes the best lattes and coffee of any place I've ever been. The pastries are unreal and baked in house with love. They recently opened their new addition and restaurant and I have to say that they have made a true iconic mark in downtown Phoenix. The menu is limited right now but everything we were served was great. Of course they still maintain their coffee house vibe and have sacrificed nothing in that area with the renovation.

The chicken wings were cold and took 35 mins to come out and people next to us were serviced dinner and we came in 30 mins before them. When I asked why everything took so long she looked at me and said chicken wings take a long time to cook. I used to work in a bar and they take 15 mins so that excuse didn't work for me. When the dinner came out the food was cold all around and when I asked if we could get warmer food she just walked away. For 3 kids meals with drinks and two adults came to $91.00.My advice is to eat before you get there there and don't be slighted this abuse of food and service. 2 Stars is what I give.,GEI6k1jX,3063

It took me a minute to figure it out (I'm about a green in the box of crayons...not bright like yellow, but not dark like midnight blue). Any who, the sandwiches all looked great, and I decided on the Club. It was a different kind of club than you would find at say Subway, since it had ham, turkey, and bacon, instead of roast beef. On said bag, you mark which ingredients you would like, hand it to the cashier and wait. It wasn't terribly busy, so the wait time was about 5.5 minutes. When I got back to the shop (I was eating with a friend @ her hair salon...great place BTW), I was pleasantly surprised. The bacon wasn't that crap microwave stuff, and it was just delectable. The sub was perfect...not too big, not too small, juuuuusssst right! They do toast it, and I'm not a big fan of toasted subs, but it was about a 2.5 on the toasted scale, and that made me happy!

I went on a gluten free diet over two years ago and have not had decent Thai food since then because of the language barrier at our favorite place.  Recently, I found Latitude 8 on the web and gave them a call.  They assured me that they could prepare many of their items gluten-free.  When I told the woman I was coming that night, she said \I am on tonight, just ask for me or the owner, David.\  She never mentioned the need for a reservation.A few hours later, my wife and I arrived at the restaurant.  When we told them we did not have a reservation (before 6:00), we were told that they could not get us within anything like a reasonable time frame, despite the fact that the majority of the tables were open.  So, we went down the street to Zocalo, which was excellent.I am still anxious to try Latitude 8 and will definitely do so as soon as possible.

Out waitress was nice, the food was good, and the beer was cold. It was a good experience till the 4th quarter...The table in front of us had a female drinking a beer who was standing for a bit blocking our view. Finally, after a few minutes out friend leaned over to their table and asked nicely if she could sit so we could see the game. She responded, \I work here\ and gave us a dirty look. Really? And? What does that have to do with the fact that we couldn't see? She was clearly not working at the moment (she was holding a beer and an unlit cigarette) and asking her to sit seemed like a simple request. She sat and began talking about our table to her friends who were with her. Our waitress stopped by to see if we needed anything and as she walked away the \standing girl\ pulled her aside. We watched her talk and point at our table to our waitress and when we made eye contact she flipped us off. Yes, she literally told us she worked there and then flipped us off! I have never been so disrespected as a patron of a restaurant!Furious now, we asked for a manager and he came over. We told him what happened and he apologized for her and said he would talk to her. A few minutes later she came back over and sat at her table proceeded to talk about us again. Finally the manager told her to leave. He came back to our table to let us know that she had been drinking, he asked her to leave and would be talking to her when she was sober. Just to confirm I wasn't crazy or overreacting, a woman at an uninvolved table came by ours after it was over and told us she watched the whole thing and was on our side. She couldn't believe that an employee would be so rude and flip us off. I guarantee I won't be back for anymore football games or anything else.

If you didnt like Glam you either were'nt there on a friday, you left too early on a friday night, or maybe you caught them on a bad night(it happens to any dj), OR, you are part of the \general market\ and should stay in Scottsdale. faux show brings it. they play music there that I NEVER hear played in any of the other so-called\hipster\ or \electro/rock\ dance party nights. They catch on to that stuff way before the other guy's in town...and when we are lucky, they even bring the acts themselves to phoenix....guarantee'd if these guy's are bringing somebody to town, it is worth the time to check it out...even if you think its not the kind of music you are into. I have heard them play some f^ck*d up shit on friday nights...styles of music i have'nt even heard before. The other hipster nights of the week, , even the above mentioned \french kiss\, pale in comparison to the element of class, style and taste that these guy's bring to the party. An above reviewer mentioned their rival night \french kiss\ as having thinned out fauxShow's friday night crowd and I can tell you first hand that that simply isn't true. I bounce back and forth from both nights frequently,  and aside from \french kiss's\ opening night people have consistently rocked the fauxShow party on a weekly basis. I dont know very many people who dont consider friday nights at glam the better deal. french kiss @homme is a mediocre facsimile of  fauxShow's friday night....I hear those fk dj's play a lot of the same music fs was playing months before and have since retired. I even remember  the guest dj's(the misshapes) at french kiss ditching the night to come pley at faux show instead. Sure its a small place and there are not many places to sit...this just means that you are forced to be a part of the action....and there isnt a patio but I have seen some crazy stuff go on in front of that place. Hot girls all over the place too...unless its an off night....and the hot girls that you actually want to talk to too, not just some bag of air with a nice rack; and if your a dude into dudes or a chick into chicks, its not a bad place to be either. Drinks are cheap all night long and they dont shut down until everyone on the dance floor cant take it anymore.  this sort of thing isnt for everyone...but if there is any cultured, underground, \cool\ ,\it\ or \hip\  thing in Phoenix to do, this is it.

I've had the shrimp scampi a couple of times, the Italian sausage with the spicy Vodka sauce-Fuhgeddabawtit!! Amazing! My guy usually sticks with the classics like spaghetti and meatballs or lasagna, but I've tried both. Yum! Wine of course is average supermarket wine but it complements their food well enough. Bread came out cold one time, but hey, I need to eat less of that anyway! Bar seems to be fun and friendly but there are plenty of TVs throughout.

Came here for the UYE, and like last time, Casey was a great host, and recommended me a glass which, once it had some time to breathe, was smooth and complex simultaneously. \Talladega Nights\ was replaced by some random movie starring Cameron Diaz and Ewan McGregor (anyone?) and a good number of folks were there for Wino Wednesdays, hanging out and having a good time. Very Cheers-ish, but with wine glasses. No REO Speedwagon on the stereo this time, though. Alas. But seriously, the scene at Centro is so non-pretentious it's hard to believe they actually have wine here. Me? I seriously would be a regular here if I lived closer.Also: this time, I engaged in some food-eating. Yes! The complimentary apps (traditional bruschetta and one piece of toast with some goat cheese) were good and my chicken panini with sweet potato chips were mighty fine and tasty. Genuinely friendly service, which given some other recent experiences in this city, was definitely appreciated. All in all, a definite hidden gem in central Scottsdale.

1585,2.2,"I've been to Public Health three times thus far. Twice for STD testing (no, I wasn't infected, I did it annually just to be safe), and once for a pregnancy test. The first thought that popped into my mind upon hearing \public health\, was \ew, yuck, dirty, gross, never!\. However, after finding out that Planned Parenthood and miscellaneous doctor's offices charged an arm and a leg for a single test, I rethought my plan. Public Health offers cheap, clean, and reliable (but limited) services. You can be tested for all diseases for $20, unlike said clinics that charge upwards of $250 per test. Their pregnancy tests are $20 as well. I don't think they take insurance, but their prices are decent for the few services they provide. I know they have a Family Planning clinic that provides well woman exams, pregnancy testing, and all that jazz. They also give immunizations. I'm not too sure of their other services but I'm sure they could tell you if you called. To make the best of your experience, shall you ever decide to go, arrive early. Going on a Monday or Friday is also a mistake, because they're closed on weekends. Yes, as Alicia B. mentioned, it is slightly \bus station meets DMV\, but let me tell you, their facilities are CLEAN. Very clean. The staff is also very friendly. The doctors I have dealt with have been professional and courteous. Besides the sketchy clientele, I felt completely safe, clean, and comfortable.

1590,1.3,"Oil, vinegar and spices for dipping your bread in is always a good start for me. We had a lovely early dinner at Caffe Boa, with dim lighting, a festive holiday tree and pleasant, attentive service. The specials sounded delicious but, we went traditional instead. We shared a half order of Sonoma Salad, (organic mixed greens, dried mission figs, sliced apples, fresh bufala mozzarella, with a raspberry vinaigrette). It was big enough to share, and each have a nice pre-pasta portion.For the entree, I was delighted by the AGNOLOTTI BOA, which are, as per the website, \Raviolis filled with a soft blend of portabella and cremini mushrooms in a flavorful sauce of tomato and seasoned cream.\  My dining partner had the lasagna, which was delicious, but too much even for him.  We took it home and enjoyed it again the next day.  That, of course meant we had room for dessert, so we went for espressos and the housemade tiramisu.  It was light and fluffy and, again, a giant portion. Service was very pleasant and not rushed. The patio looks cute and romantic for a return visit.",MXqZFyEB,768
1591,2.4,"We had dinner at Hillstone a couple nights ago.  The food was, for the most part, pretty good.  However, the service was below average.  They really need to work on training their servers better or they will lose a lot of potential repeat business.   We showed up at 7:30 and our reservation was for 8pm.  We seated ourselves on the outdoor patio (which was very nice as far as scenery/ambience).  It was awhile before a server came over to take our drink orders; we saw her go by/near tables next to us twice before she finally came over.  She made us feel rushed from the get-go; as if she was in a hurry -- it was a little strange for the relaxed atmosphere and mode we were in.  She brought us our drinks - never offered water - and when she didn't come back for awhile, my husband got up to get me water from the bar.  She soon brought a check over and we at that point said we'd like to order an appetizer.  Again, she seemed a little \put out\ by us, but took the order.  When we were halfway through our spinach dip, at about 7:50, a hostess came over and moved us indoors to our table that was \ready.\. It would have been much nicer to finish the appetizer where we were, and then have us move inside, rather than transporting everything.  Kind of strange.  There were also several tables inside - it wasn't packed with a line of people waiting or anything.Once inside, our next server (this seemed like #3 already, of what would be about 6 total servers throughout our evening) came by and was sort of awkward - saw we had half eaten spinach dip and said \looks like your all set, I'll let you enjoy that,\ without asking if there was anything else we needed at that time...again, no offer of WATER!  I asked for ice water, and she then looked to my husband...\Did you want some, too?\...OF COURSE.  Isn't that just a matter of course here in Phoenix, early September?  We were asked within a couple of minutes if we were ready to order and we hadn't even picked up the menus yet...we were talking, eating spinach dip, having drinks...again, very much a RUSHED feeling.We ordered ribs which come with \hand cut potato fries and coleslaw.\ I said I would prefer a baked potato instead of hand cut fries.  The server's EXACT response: \Okay.\  Pause... \But then you won't get the coleslaw either.  The baked potato counts as two sides.\ Um, okay...I suddenly felt like I was ordering at a fast food restaurant.  Blown away.  I said nothing; I really didn't care about having coleslaw anyways.  My husband next ordered, also with a baked potato replacing the fries, but he said \And I'd like to have my coleslaw please.\  Server response: \Okay, it will be $4.00 for the coleslaw.\ Again, wow.  Where am I?  Certainly not an upscale restaurant...can we supersize here??!Our ribs were good; we were enjoying the food (again, for the most part...good, not great).  What happened next however, was that no less than 3 random servers came by in about a 12 minute period, none of whom were our original server, asking if we were done and if they could take our plates.  We were so far from done - I had about 75% of my meal still on my plate and my husband, while he was almost done with his ribs, was still working on the baked potato and the $4.00 *supposed to be included with meal* coleslaw.  It was so incredibly annoying; they kept interrupting our conversation and what was trying to be a relaxing, enjoyable evening out.  We finally gave in and said we were done (server number 6 asking)...who were these people?  Why isn't one server and one busser assigned to each table?  That way the same question wouldn't be asked 6 times...they've got to work on this.Yet a different server came to see if we wanted anything else; my husband had to ASK for a dessert menu (it was not offered), and when he asked, server #7 (?) pretty much ignored the question and said \Let me tell you...\ and started rambling off I think four different desserts.  This would be fine, I suppose (even though I really prefer to read it from a menu and make my decision...a little more time, less pressure..) but we couldn't understand what she was saying was on top of the hot fudge sundae.  The place is a little loud...my husband asked her to repeat it, we both still missed it...I asked again...\What's on top of the sundae?\ And again, we both missed it.  Could not understand..whatever, this is why I'd like a dessert menu to READ.  I finally said, \We'll have the key lime pie,\ because we both still had no clue what might come on top of that sundae if we ordered it!The key lime pie was disappointing.  We shared a piece and between the two of us we did not even finish half of it.  The crust had cinnamon in it, which tasted so wrong with key lime pie.  The kind of crust you would use for a pumpkin pie.  All in all, not rushing back to Hillstone anytime soon.  They have got to work on the wait staff.  Too many people involved in our meal throughout the night and obviously not in a good way.",bouLBrO1,1419
1592,3.4,"We tried this place for the first time last night. I have to say this place is quite impressive. After being ruined by \Chili's\ or \Applebees\ burgers I have lost faith in the valley's mainstream burger providers. This place was very different. To start out they bring you a starter plate of \home\made chips. Very nice touch. Not the same old gimmick. The first thing you'll notice is the sushi bar style menu. Pick what you want and fill in the bubble. Very interesting concept. My wife, the ever simple eater ordered the grilled cheese sandwich and fries. This is the first ever grilled cheese sandwich I have seen that actually had flavor and wasn't soaked in grease. The fries were crispy and done right. Not limp, actually cooked through, and crispy. Almost like they were fried twice (like fries are supposed to be). I ordered the fried dill pickle chips. While they weren't earth shattering, they were good. Served with the standard ranch dressing. For my meal, I went all the way and ordered the \Vesuvius\. It is a burger with cheese in the middle. It had a little warning next to it. Heed the warning. My first bite into the sandwich was absolutely painful. Molten cheese came shooting out, and I felt like an idiot. After giving it a little cooling time, the burger was easily the best burger I have had in a long time. Overall this is a good place to eat. I was very impressed. I will have to go back and try the other options on their menu.... Like the Kobe burger....",n5WM0jZq,4589

1594,1.2,"I don't claim to be an expert on good BBQ.  In fact, I didn't eat much of it until I married my husband, a southern boy.  I've since learned what I like and Lucille's is not it.We stopped in for lunch while running an errand at Marketplace.  First, the lemonade.  I have a sweet tooth, but this was ridiculous.  Does the owner have stock in C&H?    It was very tasty once it had watered down by the end of my meal.  Next, biscuits.  Tasty and doubles as a hand grenade it you attempt to split it open.  Fried green tomatoes.  Not bad, but could have been called ame that vegetable.\  Kind of bland.  Potato salad.  I love a good potato salad.  I didn't have one yesterday.  Way too much dressing.  Maybe the same person that controls the sugar in the lemonade prepares the potato salad.  I shouldn't be able to eat just the potatoes and have enough dressing left in the bowl for another salad.Finally, the BBQ.  I had the pulled pork sliders.  I made the mistake of assuming the pork was served dry as there was sauce on the table.  Wrong.  Okay, I can live with that.  On a positive note, the sauce was sweet and spicy and carmelized nicely.  But, it completely overpowered the meat.  What I really didn't like was the big globs of fat in every slider.  There's not much meat in a slider as it is.  Maybe that's why they call it a \slider.\  The fat just slides down your throat. Since everyone has a different idea of what makes good BBQ, I wouldn't discourage anyone from trying it.  I do highly suggest lunch rather than dinner as a starting point.  We payed half as much for me to determine I'm not interested in coming back.  What about dessert you ask? Just have the lemonade.",YwHeVR27,4676

However, after you go through the program several times, it becomes deathly boring and many people will find they want to terminate after a few months. In my case, the cost to terminate was $139.I haven't done the cross fit training that's popping up everywhere but people I know who have done both cross fit and Orange Theory say cross fit is much better and cheaper too.  Also, research it for yourself if they tell you that you're losing 1,000 calories per session. They claim that you keep burning calories for almost 20 hours after each session. I looked at all the info I could find about this on line and the actual story is that you continue to burn a moderate amount of calories for about 40 minutes after the workout after which any enhanced burn rate falls off to almost nothing. Orange Theory claims the full 20 hours as though you're burning calories at something close to the rate you do while in the class. In my opinion, it's deceptive and they know it.Overall, before you sign up to their supposed o contract\, ask to meet whoever you'll be dealing with when you want to leave.

1600,3.8,"Full disclosure, and I'm sure warranting a \filtered\ review, I've known the owners of the Fly for a lot of years (Backstage, anyone else this old?).  They've been in the biz for a long time now, and it's evident at this bistro.  This is a very relaxed, easy-going little place that has a lot going for it.  The patio area is great with our year-round climate, inside is spacious enough, homey decor.  I've only been there 4 times in the past year they've been open (this incarnation, I had not been to the previous Dragonfly), but have each time really enjoyed my meal.  The first visit was a deja vu-inducing lahvosh (recommend the Dragonfly Special,add green chile; there could be more green chile heat for me, jalapenos maybe but not what I'm looking for here; just hotter green chile).  Who doesn't like that dofino cheese?  Second visit was Fernando's chicken sandwich, nice orzo salad; chicken was moist and spicy, and the jack was ok but you could probably ask for dofino again.  Visit 3 was early evening, again with that patio!  Nice.  They had just started serving dinner, and the menu was more limited, burgers, sandwiches, salads and new desserts.  The signature burger was excellent, properly cooked, beefy cheesy oniony bacony goodness.  4 napkin rating.  Orzo again.  I was last there for dinner again on \Dine Out  For Life\ night, a benefit for HIV/AIDS care and research, to which the Fly donated a percentage of their proceeds for the entire day.  (There they go again, doing good things for their community...)  Lahvosh with herbed butter on the table almost instantly.  Soup du jour was a beautiful red roasted garlic, red pepper and tomato, very good; special salad of baby greens and lots of other add-ins with goat cheese.  My entree was the night's fish special, fried tilapia with a side of ratatouille-like fresh vegetable medley.  I enjoyed them both very much, though a different plating arrangement might have kept the fish a little crisper on the bottom.  A smooth mustard sauce accompanied.  The other guy let me taste his Hard Apple Cider Pot Roast, grilled asparagus, and au gratin squash; good seasoning, melting beefy protein, non-squishy vegetables done al dente, all \very good\ directly quoted.  Marinated all natural Red Bird roasted chicken breast tastes supplied by another friend nearby, and I completely loved that dish as well.  They can create a nicely seasoned moist chicken breast, not an easy task for a lot of kitchens.  I've tried and liked all of the dessert menu at one time or another, though not a huge apple fan, I loved the others.  Very sweet for the most part, which is fine by me but maybe others will need some gelato to cut the sweetness.  That was not a problem with the dessert special last time, a mocha cake with deep chocolate ganache and gelato.  Great finish.I have not been to the restaurant for breakfast yet, but the menu looks interesting, especially that banana's foster french toast dessert I mean entree.  Water and beverages served promptly and refilled often, I'm an iced tea addict and their's has good tea flavor.  Wine and full bar available if you want.  Some great wine specials offered usually and there's a happy hour.Sure, I know the owners.  Sure, I wish I could get there more often, but it's about 15 miles OW.  But I also dine out a lot, and compared to all of those, the Fly's got it together.  They try to find local food sources, quality and organic ingredients, creativity and even wholesomeness and nutritive value on their evolving menu.  Jene and Ann are great people with terrific children out there living the American Dream.  They care about their community and are employing some great staff.  They'll get to know and treat you as family after a couple of visits, which is really what those neighborhood places are all about.  There's good value and really good food on their menu, so Yay!

1601,2.3,"The family and I were at the Scottsdale Quarter a couple of weeks ago just walking around looking for a place to eat so we decided to try Grimaldi's. It was on. Sunday at around 2:00pm and it was not very crowded at all. Most of the patio tables were occupied, but inside was somewhat empty. When we walked up to the host/hostess stand we told them we wanted a table for four, two adults and two young children. We were immediately told that there would be a 30 minute wait because the pizza ovens were at capacity so they could not seat anymore tables. That was a first for me. Half the inside was empty, the patio was 95% occupied, not incredibly busy at all, but the ovens were at capacity??? I guess I had \Gullible Idiot\ written across my forehead or something. It was obvious that they had other issues going on, either short of staff or something else, but at least tell the truth. A pizza restaurant half empty and the ovens are full... yeah fine, if you don't want our business that is fine. End result... I was so turned off by the treatment and attitude of the guy who handled us I just walked out. No way to treat a family at all.

I loved the salad and would order it again in a heartbeat.For dinner my wife and I got the Smart Chicken and the Wagyu Burger.  the Smart Chicken was rich and tasty.  Definitely a good call.  The burger had some very interesting flavor combinations that were all a good call.  The sliced carrots and pickled onions made a nice crunchy taste to the burger.  The Challah bun was a nice touch, but ended up being a little more dry that I would have desired.  To provide some honest feedback, I told our server that the food was great, but that the bun was a little dry.  She went and talked with the Chef and came back to tell us that they were really sorry that the bun was dry and that they wanted to comp our burger.  Wow, that was completely not necessary, but incredibly nice!

This was probably the best. It had a great \millet\ (like grits), and it went so well with the perfectly cooked duck.The only thing I would suggest, it to NOT get the Pork Belly and Bacon Sandwich together. There was just a bit too much bacon/pork flavor, it detracted a bit from the meal. It would have been helpful if the server had mentioned that.Overall, I would highly recommend Citizen Public House.

I was hoping it would be good....god I was hoping it would be good.I called at 7pm (They close at 8) and asked if they still had ribs today.  The owner ended up getting on the phone and told me he has plenty.  I then asked him what he would do with the rest in 1 hour and he said freeze them.  He said that sometimes the ribs wont get eaten for 2-3 days.  ACK!I asked if he had fresh ones and he told me yes.  I drove over there in 2 minutes and he began MICROWAVING the ribs.  I asked him what he was doing and he said \warming up the ribs\  I was in shock.....had I been wrong about all the BBQ places i've been too?  Do they too microwave their ribs in the back and then serve it to me?  I decided not to judge yet.  I asked him where his smoker was at and he said it was at the Buckeye location.  Huh? So where is the meat made I asked....He told me Buckeye makes it...then delivers it to them later in the day.  Bleh...ok ok dont judge yet Ron...eat it first I said.  I got home and split the rack with my roomate.  I ordered it sauce ont he side so I can gauge the flavor of the meat....and I am SUPER glad I did.The sauce tasted like tangy ketchup.  The Meat?  Well it tasted like Microwaved Ribs...what else?  You ever have left overs from a BBQ place and try to microwave them?  It was EXACTTLY like that.Wow...I give this place my ultimate \edible\ lowest rating.

1629,3.5,"A pleasant find in Historic Downtown Chandler!   A lovely space with an interior stone wall, wooden beams and an inviting bar area.  While it took a little time for any server to appear, despite the fact that they were not very busy, the food definitely made up for any delays.  We started with the Cozze e Vongole Saltate - tender saut\u00e9ed clams and mussels in a delicious garlic broth.  (The female busser keep us well plied with bread to sop up the flavorful broth - but be careful not to fill up too much on bread!)  The salads (Insalata Mediterranea & Insalata Pugliese) were excellent due to the fresh mesclun greens, wonderful cheeses and high quality balsamic and olive oil.  We all had different variations of veal - Saltimbocca alla Romana (tender scallopine with prosciutto in a rich buttery sauce), Vitello alla Griglia (an expertly grilled marinated veal chop - basic but exquisite), and Involtini di Vitello (mozzarella and prosciutto wrapped in veal with a rich sherry sauce with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms).  The Involtini was especially terrific and our server's favorite recommendation as well.  The vegetables that come with the dinners are also quite good - a m\u00e9lange of carrots, red potatoes, cabbage.  Even though we had finished our veal, we thought about bringing the extra vegetables home!  I am always looking for places that are kid-friendly that are not chains.  They were very accommodating to the 10 month old we brought with us, too.  Save room (or take home) the tiramisu: it is unbelievable!  Cappuccino was even noteworthy.  Despite the typos in the menu (pet peeve of mine) and even PRINTED on the beautiful wall of the restaurant (i.e. \receipes\) - (*gasp* - okay,  HUGE pet peeve of mine), La Stalla Cucina Rustica is a welcome star in a slew of mediocre Italian restaurants in the valley.",exqtHxMv,756
1630,2.6,"Dang. Duh -HAng This is goo foo! My mom is deathly allergic to shellfish. That, and I grew up in a desert for 10 of my formative years. When I think of shellfish, I think of slightly forbidden, delicious little delicacies. While growing up the idea of lobster and crab was the ultimate indulgence in haught cuisine, it seemed. . The only time my Mom liked fish is when it didn't taste like fish. \I like swordfish because it's not fishy\, or \ooh orange roughy is so good! It's not fishy at all\. I wanted fishy fish. I wanted something that tasted like the ocean. I wanted to see why lobster and crab was so expensive. In more selfish and morbid moments I hoped a chef would accidentally drop a shrimp into her food so she would die, and I could eat all the seafood I wanted. There's no lobster at Oscar's Pier 83, but you can get things here that are really rare in Arizona, and plenty of it is exquisitely fishy, in the freshest way imaginable. I did takeout and I ordered a lot of food: Oscar's Ultimate Combo (1 Jumbo Shrimp, 1 Jumbo Sea Scallop, 1 Oyster, 1 House Fish, 1 Chicken Strip, 1/4 pound Fried Clam Strips, Fries, Cole Slaw) THEN Fried Soft-shell Crab Crab cake Clam Chowder It was all at least 4 stars. The Exquisite: The Fried Oyster- My god this was good. Keep in mind I told you I like fishy fish, but this thing was fresh, juicy, full of meat, and perfectly matched my seafood craving. I thought it was a scallop at first, which is one of my favorite things on earth- but it was so much better than any scallop I've ever had. The Fried Soft Shell Crab- This was served with a pink remoulade like sauce that was divine. This thing was meaty, a little salted, and perfectly flavored. The remoulade was excellent. The Crab cake- It had a ton of crab in it. The only one I've had that was better was in Maryland overlooking the water. Dipped in the remoulade this more than just good. The Clam Chowder- It spilled in the car, in the bag, so I brought it in and ate the chowder with a spoon out of the bag. It was that good. The Very Good- The House Fish- Really good. Probably the best I've had. What's weird is that I think the excellence of the oyster and soft shell crab overshadowed this. Had I had this on it's own I'd probably be raving about it. It wasn't fishy at all. The Scallop- It was a little dry and bland. Very big however. The Shrimp- Better than a lot of shrimp I've had in Arizona- but not the best I've ever had. The Chicken Strip- Had I been more present at the time of ordering I would have tried to substitute this for something else. When I go again, I will order the soft shell crab, 3 oysters, and some clam chowder. Maybe I'll bring in my mom and Oscar will be the one to finally do her in with a stray piece of shrimp (DEVIL LAUGH). I kid, I kid.",zfV6JWWg,4120
1631,3.4,"saturday afternoon: after a busy morning of \Total.Hangover.Cure\ induced shopping at the saturday market and then an eventful trip to Trader Joe's my buddy Polo and I were getting apprehensive with Hunger. I was eager to take him somewhere that would fit his requirements (cheap/plentiful) so that he wouldnt embarass me like he had at a \colorful\ brunch my brother and I had taken him to at FEZ, which ended in him loudly and unapologetically complaining about portion sizes and price. My best bud Polo is a big dude, and accordingly a rather big penny pincher. I was driving us back to my pad when we passed Yoshi's on central, \whats that place?\ he says, \oh, just like this japanese fast food place, it's slightly better than kyoto bowl..\ he nearly grabbed the steering wheel outta my hands.I veered into the drive thru, ordered a chicken yakisoba bowl for him, and a chicken curry for myself. As we waited for our orders a group of elderly folks strolled by, donna summer was playing on the radio, impulsively i blasted her sweet disco melodies as loud as my car speakers would allow, and we had an improtu dance party in my car as they stared in horror and confusion. the gal who worked at yoshi's opened the drive thru window, laughed and handed us our orders. We took my groceries and our Yoshi's bowls back to my pad, had a quick refresher, and dug into our Yoshi's bowls as we watched always sunny and spent the rest of the afternoon with full belly's of joy. Yoshi's is an easy, fast, and fairly decent alternative to panda or KytBwl, i'll be back soon most likely.",bB3TMMKn,4863
1632,4.2,"The menu has changed substantially in the past year or two.  I was pretty impressed with the new menu when my husband and I moved back downtown after a year in Tempe.  Back downtown, we rekindled our habit of getting tickets at the AMC then sitting around for a couple hours next door at Pizzeria Uno before the movie.This isn't just pizza anymore.  They have a variety of healthier options, salads, pastas, burgers, and just about anything that you can think of getting at any typical American chain restaurant.  I'm not a big fan of chains, but I'm excited to see the changes made to their menu.We decided to get an appetizer of wings (because we're from Buffalo, and that is the way of our people) to start off the meal.  When the waiter said they only had one type of sauce, \Buffalo,\ I had my reservations about how authentic or even decent these wings would be.  So we ordered the smallest size of 8 wings figuring that even if they were not what we expected that we wouldn't feel to hosed with 8 wings.  They were actually good!  The hubby even said if he knew how good they were going to be, he would have just ordered a large order for himself.  Don't get me wrong, these are not the best wings, but they are more than adequate and at the very least good.  The sauce is not Frank's and Butter, but it was a reasonable facsimile: a little hot, a little vinegary.  We asked for them to be cooked crispy and they did, but I can't confirm if that's how they would come if you don't ask.The rest of our meal was tasty, quick and as ordered as it has been every other time we've eaten here.  The service is consistently friendly and good.",oSiM1MSE,1332

I ordered a sausage and peppers to go with cheese and a large side of fries (\more than enough he said for 2 to share). The sausage, while tasty enough, was pretty dry. Then crusty white bread had too many REALLY REALLY mushy parts. Basically half of it fell apart like my Aunt Helen did when I told her I was a mo. The crinkle fries were awesome. Crinkly and crunchy. Though not the enormous portion I anticiapted.  The large fries were $3.75 and the sandwich was $5.50. Service was spot on. Friendly and fast.

Now as for the Cinema itself....well considering it has only been around for 7 months or so....i must say I was very impressed. The staff was very friendly and professional.....the Cinema has everything to offer from a great food lounge.....and let me say the prices are not bad either.....to a various array of movie options. All the movie rooms are fully digital....3D capable.....DBox motion seats....and the Star Class are for 21 and over only. Now night shows for adults run 9.75 per person....if you see a movie in Star Class it is 2 bucks more....3D 3 bucks more.....and DBox motion seats......8 bucks more.We got a great deal with \Deal Chicken\ which is like Groupon and Living Social so we used our voucher for tonight's show. There were only 40 seats in our Cinema....side by side....wide chairs....with plenty of legroom and no one could walk in front of you. They even have a red button you can push at anytime during the movie to call for a waiter to take your order or assist you with any problem. The reason this locale didn't get 5 stars was because the walls are very thin. We could here the other movie next door at times....and that was very distracting. I am planning on making a call to the Cinema tomorrow to talk to the manager about that very issue.  However that didn't get anyone down....we truly enjoyed our movie and I highly recommend that anyone who reads this to give this cinema a try and don't forget THE CHEESE POPCORN!!!!

1636,1.7,"Five years ago I had stayed at this hotel and would have given it a wonderful review but I was not yet a member of YELP so I could not. This time I can!! I just got back from a 3 day stay here. I booked my rooms directly on the Marriott website so I could utilize my discount. I returned to this hotel because it is one of the few in the area that I could find with the two bedroom two bathroom suite. Once again, this hotel did not disappoint. They still have their free wired internet, free buffet style breakfast, heated pool and spa, and VERY nice rooms!! They have done a total re-model since the last time I was here. I didn't see anything wrong with the rooms last time but hey...the rooms REALLY stand out now! The full kitchen and living room are added bonuses.Location: This hotel is in a great location for just about everything in Tempe and Downtown Phoenix. It's RIGHT across the street from the Arizona Mills Mall; leave your car at the hotel and walk!! Everything you could want to eat, drink, and be merry is at the mall or VERY close to it. Hotel is right next door to a CVS. GO there and get your bottled water and drinks. NOTE: Do NOT drink the Hotels bottled water or they will charge you. Across the street is a McDonalds, Wendys, Home Depot, 50's Diner and another 7 minute walk gives you Carls Jr, Claim Jumper & Joes Crab Shack. The Phoenix International Airport is 10 minutes away. There's a \shortcut\ to the airport if you go down Priest street to University but don't use GPS because it will keep trying to get you to go down I-10! (Which may be easier if you are prone to get lost like I am.)Employees: Everyone was very nice and helpful. Housekeeping always gave me the extra towels I requested. The woman that works the breakfast buffet was exceptionally nice. Even though the buffet closed at 9:30 AM, she let me come at 9:45 to eat. I made sure to tip her every day. Internet: Free and fast! It is wired, yes, but to even be able to FIND free internet at any hotels in Tempe and Phoenix is amazing, especially in a suite!! The other places I looked at wanted $9.99 a night!! I did not mind one bit having to hook into the wired router. They have a computer/printer set up in the lobby as well.Room: Very clean and classy! TONS of storage! (I believe all of these rooms were once apartments.) I like the way they re-modeled everything.  Clean fresh linens. NO Bedbugs!! Living room and kitchen are a wonderful added bonus. There's also a fireplace but with it being 90\u00ba out, I did not need to use it. The bathrooms are also VERY nice. Love the bow out shower curtain rods! The showerhead is a big ol' fancy thing; water pressure is excellent. Tubs and sinks drained great. Lots of windows throughout the unit. The room curtains are very good at keeping the room dark until you want to let the light in. With the Arizona sun, it was nice to open the windows but also keep the sheers in front to minimize the heat factor.Parking: FREE!! YAY!!! Late Check Out: YAY!!!! I will definitely stay here again the next time I am in Phoenix. It's a no brainer!!",mtgqWNjV,3330

After an intense talent and speech competition, the gelato from Frost was declared the winner!I've been to the store in Gilbert a handful of times. I'm always impressed that the service does not flounder when the line increases. What is the hurry when you're about to enjoy something wonderful? My personal faves are the mango sorbet, strawberry yogurt, and chocolate hazelnut crunch. I took a few different flavors to be the dessert for a family dinner recently, and it was the talk of the meal! My mother is quite picky with desserts, but she gushed over the blackberry cabernet.The employees are always friendly and engaging. The store has a shimmer about it,  like it has been freshly waxed and buffed by elves the night before. They allowed me to try several flavors before I made my decision. There is no \omg this is going straight to my waist/hips\ anxiety like there is with ice cream. Frost's gelato is lighter and healthier without sacrificing on taste. It has flavor for days! I wish I could say that I knew Frost before it was cool, but it's too late, it already is.",vvtdPncc,3928

My mom is very crafty and talented, so I guess I inherited her creativity. People here grumble about how expensive this place is, well be a smart shopper and download their application or use coupons. I have saved up to 40% here because I have downloaded their Iphone application. They also have a rewards card, so more savings there!One of the items that I like about this shop is they carry my favorite glue called \Liquid Fusion\. This stuff bonds to everything and doesn't stick to your fingers like super glue. I can't seem to find that stuff anywhere else except Michael's.I needed it for my Halloween costume for the yelp event, so I went here to buy it.That product is awesome. I wish they'd carry them in bigger sizes because I use it for everything. They carry blank masks here also, but they don't carry the bird mask that I need for my costume, so I went on line.If you want to know where to buy a blank Venetian bird mask (similar to mine), go to brandsonsale.com or eBay.Then you can purchase the feathers, paint, glitter and other embellishments at Michael's.",4tZoJVwQ,205

We waited a few minutes and were able to get two chairs at the bar. If you're sitting at the bar, you're essentially in the open kitchen as well. Like I said, it's very small! We had an awkward few minutes at the bar (sitting in front of people's empty plates), but someone finally gave us menus. We ordered draft beer - Rogue Hazelnut Brown, which happens to be one of our favorites. I've never seen it on tap before, so we were pretty excited to try it. It did not disappoint! We ordered our pasties; I had the bangers and mash and my husband had the chicken tikka masala. I think we'd agree that they were both good, but nothing mind-blowing.  My husband is from England and thought the sausages didn't taste authentic. They were extremely sage-y and a bit tough. I was a bit disappointed that the \mash\ was really just chunks of potatoes. The red wine gravy served on the side was good. I think it was a bit pricey for what we got - two pasties and two beers for $28. I wouldn't make a special trip to Tempe to have it again.",cIKEqM5s,4006
1641,4.6,"If you like buffets, the area around Indian Bend and 101 is a good place to be, since you find the Wandering Horse Buffet, Sweet Tomatoes, YC's Mongolian Grille, and Oriental Garden Super Buffet all within a mile.  The Oriental Garden has always been enjoyable, but we have neglected it recently in favor of the newer, fancier Wandering Horse and the \healthier\ Sweet Tomatoes, so it's time to do a comparison check.  We were delighted to discover that the Oriental Garden has responded to the new competition by kicking it up a notch.  Though it may lack the flash (and the liquor license) of the Wandering Horse, it offers almost as much for half the price.  They may not have Kobe beef, but they have a sushi section which has doubled in size since our last visit, with tuna, salmon, and eel nigiri, a selection of maki, and some interesting seafood-filled pastries.  And let me not forget the crab legs, baked salmon, and flounder.  Plus shrimp more ways than you can count.  For seafood, OG leaves WH in the dust.  All the Chinese buffet staples are there, and fresher than most other Chinese buffets.  They still don't compete on desserts, but have added an excellent chocolate cake to get in the running.  Overall, Oriental Garden clearly holds its own in this competition, and may be our first choice.  Meat eaters may prefer Wandering Horse, vegetarians or those wishing they were on a diet may choose Sweet Tomatoes, pasta lovers or those with a need for spicier food should try YC's, but seafood lovers and those simply looking for good bang-for-the-buck will wind up at Oriental Garden.",oVi4napE,4411

We were seated on the patio along with several other guests, but for some reason our server only had one table on the patio - us.  And she constantly forgot about us.  It took about 30 minutes to get our drinks and place our order.  The food was out in reasonable time (someone else delivered it).  But then no check to see if everything looks good, is as-ordered, nada.  After we got our food, we didn't see her again for 30 minutes!  Our food was gone, but empty plates remained.  Our first round of cocktails was long gone (and we would have had more if offered).  By the time she came out to bring us our check even our waters were bottomed out!  She brought the check with no apology and didn't offer to refill drinks, and left the dirty and obviously empty plates.  We gave her our credit card right away fearing we may not see her again for another hour.  And if you can believe it we sat for another 30 minutes after giving her our card!  At this point, we missed the movie we were hoping to catch and we were not happy.  She came back out to patio, saw us, and rudely asked \did she not bring you the check?!?\... we say, \ummm no\ thinking, obvioulsy not, we are still here amongst dirty dishes and empty glasses... she stormed off with a huff and no explanation or apology.  The manager brought out our final check a few minutes later and did end up apologizing for the internal miscommunication, and offered to buy us another round of drinks.  We passed; after sitting for 2 hours at this place we wanted to run far far away.  IMO he shouldn't have charged us for the first round of drinks when he personally ran our card.  But no, he went ahead and charged us full price for everything with only an offer for a couple of drinks.  We will NEVER eat here again.  Terrible service.",smvGH25y,3080

1650,4.9,"I have found my new favorite sushi spot.I wish it was closer to Tempe, but it's worth the drive.You can tell by their menu that Hana strives to be an authentic Japanese restaurant, as opposed to the sake bomber joint that only has food so they can call themselves a restaurant. You know the kind; the Phoenix area is plagued with them. Hana is BYOB, and there are only a few ridiculous fusion rolls on their sushi menu: most of it is authentic, real sushi. On my first visit I started with my usual appetizers, and was immediately struck by how unusually fresh and tasty they were. The seaweed salad had just the right amount of sesame oil, giving it incredible flavor. The veggie gyoza were indescribably delicious. They made me realize I'd never had a fresh gyoza before; every one I'd eaten previously in my life was a pale imitation of these little bits of Heaven.The sushi came out fast, even though it was fairly busy this particular Thursday. The first thing I noticed, naturally, was that someone put a burning sugar cube on the tray. \Hey, fire!\ I thought. It was a nice touch.Then I saw, nestled between the flaming sugar and the wad of wasabe, a small pile of what looked like pickle relish. I guessed what it was, and our waitress confirmed it: it was FRESH wasabe.Real, fresh-grated wasabe is something most people never experience. Most people don't even know the pasty green stuff that's standard in every sushi restaurant is just normal horseradish dyed green. The real stuff is just too expensive, and too difficult to keep on hand. But there it was, no extra charge. It adds a little spice and a wonderful, fruity complexity to the sushi. The sushi was great. They also have a large menu with all the other Japanese dishes you'd expect, but I didn't try any of them. Next time.",qBNmIssM,3394

1653,3.4,"Stopped in on Saturday for lunch. Place was dead, only one other couple in the restaurant. Noticed speakers on the wall, but no music was playing. Not exactly a jovial atmosphere for a wonderful spring day in March. I ordered the Carne Asada and a Cochinita Pibil to be washed down with an Horchata. I then proceeded to the Salsa bar which appeared to have an outstanding selection and I immediately started filling cups with the many varietals eagerly anticipating being able to dress up my tacos. Chips were then brought out to snack on while I waited for my food. I can only describe these as cold, flavorless, and typical of most chain restaurant chips. Not a good sign. My Taco's arrived shortly thereafter. Unfortunately these too were nothing to write home about. The tortillas were cold and appeared store bought. The carne asada was overcooked and lacked any form of flavor. I attempted to spice things up by adding salsas, but these too were flavorless. Very little spice and hardly any seasoning. The cochinita pibil was enjoyable, as it was juicy and tasted like a quality cut of pork, but wrapped inside of a cold store bought tortilla the experience was muted. I highly doubt I will be returning to this restaurant, and I honestly question those that have written such outstanding reviews. My opinion, no taco shop should bill itself as \Gourmet\ if it does not make its own tortillas, has bland salsas, and cannot make a juicy and flavorful carne asada.",dG3LkQDT,4782

Aaamazing.My boyfriend and I were at home deciding whether it was worth the effort to get up and go get dinner, due to the disgusting heat of course, and I decided to check out Yelp and see what sounded good enough to get me out the door. Found this place, and he had been there before, given he literally lives across the street. (This is now a dangerous, dangerous thing given how much I loved this place.)Everyone who works here: super nice. We chatted for quite a while when placing our order and even got a recommendation for a Thai place down the road. I ordered the chicken schnitzel cordon bleu, my boyfriend ordered pork schnitzel. Everything was fantastic. You get three salads and a side, my side was mashed potatoes (lots of dill, yummm) and I got sauerkraut, the potato salad and peas (I ended up getting the basil tomatoes when served by mistake, which actually was fine because they were delish...only thing that was \wrong\ with our visit, which is not a big deal at all to me). Ended up taking half of my schnitzel home, the portions were super generous. We got a Beaver cookie and two of the chocolate balls to take home...just as amazing as dinner.

1656,2.5,"Through Stevey, I first heard of this place as a great little loungey place for food and wine and was surprised I had never heard of it. About two weeks ago, I decided to finally drop off the rest of my over-due (by like FOUR MONTHS...maybe more) books, which embarrassingly enough contained OutKasts Idlewood DVD that I probably owe 135 dollars in fine for keeping. The shame. I had already spent a relaxing day in Phoenix, had a light lunch, and when walking back to the car, realized Cheuvront was RIGHT THERE. I decided to brave crossing the \street\ (since the light rail construction was going on right there) and check it out. It was like 3 something and I indulged in a glass of wine outside on the patio. The beeping of a construction vehicle didnt even deter from my experience, and I think the construction may be exactly what is hurting this business considering what should be its prime location.Stevey wanted to meet up with a Brooklyn-ite here, so I made it here (even passing it to be honest) after checking the menu on-line to see if I could eat anything. I am lactose-intolerant, so going to a cheese place is kinda asking for the house of pain, and is about as smart as me being a meat free person going to a steak house. Yeah. But they had some good salad options so I went for it. I went for the Salad Nicoise, after convincing my other table mates to indulge in an appetizer (it seemed dumb to not sample at least SOME of the cheese this place has to offer) and it was fantastic. I def. want to try the Spanish plate with almonds, and fig cake and all that good stuff next time. My salad was yummy-there was so much Tuna I had to give it away, but no one complained despite their huge steaks and bacon wrapped shrimp to eat. Overall, it was fantastic with the super light cab by the glass I chose, but I must confess I found the salad a tiny bit bland-a little more seasoning and better quality potatoes would have pushed this salad to a new place.The place was inhabited by some big groups of ladies gettin their pre-game on, and it was pretty empty with just us there. I really think it isnt busy due to the horrible predictament with the light rail construction in front. Next time you are near the Heard, Art museum or Library, stop by here for a cheese plate or salad and some great wine, esp. near Lunch hours.One note: the bathrooms, while innovative, were so confusing-who on a date wants to look like an asshole who cant open a door to the bathroom?

Five minutes later a different server came over and had taken over our tab.  So problem solved.We had a couple of the 1/2 price apps.  They were good - calamari and potato skins.

1667,1.4,"What I thought would have been a very nice and romantic Valentine's Day dinner at the Four Seasons resort Crescent Moon restaurant turned out to be a stunning disappointment. First of all, we were seated outside- twice. The staff member who brought us out there took us immediately back in because he thought the hostess had made a mistake. But no, the mistake was his, so back out we went. Did I mention there was a light drizzle outside? Fortunately, we were flanked by two heaters so searing I wondered if I would have to reach for the Solarcaine when I got home. We got menus right away, but waited quite a while even for some water. When our waitress took our order for food, she did not even ask if we wanted drinks, even though my husband was holding the wine list open in his hands. When I asked for a gin, she did not bother to ask my husband if he cared for anything. When I got my gin, my glass was chipped. She apologized and brought me another. Unfortunately for all of us, this turned out to be only her first apology of the night.We got a basket of breads which were just ok- some may have even been a bit on the tough side. Then a waiter came over and tried to give us entrees that were not ours, and we had not even had the first course of their special Valentine's Day menu. At last our sweet corn cream soup arrived, with a strip of poblano and a goat cheese empanada floating in it. Hubby liked it better than I did, but I do not care much for sweets at dinner. It was pretty good for what it was. Our entrees consisted of a petite filet, some king crab leg meat (out of the shell), and Yorkshire pudding with creamed spinach on top. We both ordered our beef medium rare, but what we got was overdone on one side and rare on the other. The crab was nearly inedible- it tasted like it had been previously frozen, and was totally overdone and chewy. Having just spent Christmas on the gulf coast catching and eating crab, we know what fresh tastes like and this was NOT it. When the waitress came to check on us and Hubby commented on the crab, she offered to bring us a new plate of it. We declined, not trusting they could get it right. We also had to let her know that steak knives would have been nice for our steak. The pudding and spinach were decent.The dessert was the stand-out of the whole dinner: a small scoop of very dark chocolate ice cream (house made), a coconut cake (really more like a big soft cookie) topped with a layer of firm chocolate and then with a circle of flan. The presentation was nice and the small drops of super fresh caramel sauce as decor were so delicious that I would have purchased a jar to take home. Props to the pastry chef. However, I had to ask for coffee and cream, and then she did not bring sugar. How freaking specific do I have to be? It was just the tip of the iceberg in a night of thoughtless service. The first reviewer commented that the \service was good- but you cannot expect less-- it's the Four Seasons!\ I would have expected this to be true, but left completely astonished that the staff was so poorly managed or trained that we had to ask for beverages and proper utensils, that our menus were left on the table until the first course arrived, that the bread and butter were still on the table as we left, that I was served my drink in a chipped glass, and that we were seated outside when it was drizzling. Let alone the decidedly mediocre food- as DINKs, we do not mind spending $150 on a good meal. But when we left wishing we'd gone to Arriba, that's a problem. Oh- and my last impression? No soap in the ladies' room.UPDATE: I wrote to corporate- something I almost never do. I got a very quick response, and then a few days later another from the local food manager who offered to comp us a meal. Not being the type to complain just in order to get free stuff, I declined. I figured that if I were in charge, I sure as hell would want to know if food, service, and housekeeping were far below the standard that my \brand\ suggested.",ZokJ6LNl,4994

1669,2.8,"Ahhhh...heavenly Marriott bed, how I love thee.  The best thing about a full-service Marriott is their beds.  Hands down.  After working 12 hour days I know I can climb under the fluffy down comforter and fall asleep within minutes.  Those beds are the bomb people.  The beds at this Marriott didn't disappoint...but the rest of the hotel fell a little short.  It's an older property and a little overdue for a makeover.  Simply put, it's just not the nicest Marriott I have ever stayed in.  Maybe it's the location (downtown Mesa is not the most exciting place) but the hotel was pretty vacant when I was staying there.  My guess is that the hotel management's theory is that if there are no guests there to accommodate, why bother putting forth the effort.  The staff was nice, not the best but definitely not the worst.  The housekeeping didn't skimp on the cleaning...but they definitely skip on the towels.  Maybe they were ticked off that I used the majority of my towels each day (hey, I'm 2 shower a day gal with the wicked hot temps in Phoenix!) but there were 3, yes 3, days that I was left towel-less.  Zero.  Not even a wash cloth.  I learned my lesson after the first time and always checked to make sure I have towels BEFORE getting into the shower, but come on people.  Towels are just SUPPOSED to be there; right along with the free Bath and Body Works shampoo and lotion that has a weird scent they don't even sell in the stores.  Each time I called the front desk they would have towels to my room within minutes, but the point is that I shouldn't even have to worry about not being stocked with towels.  If it wasn't for the fact that I had to \air-dry\ one night after my shower, I would probably have given this property 3 stars.  As a previous reviewer stated they do give you milk and cookies each night if you are on the executive floors so that was a nice touch.

1671,1.2,"Just came from a two day stay at this hotel, and I must say, an extreme disappointment. I've stayed at many Hilton hotels all over the world, all of which have been very enjoyable, but this one is undeserving of the Hilton brand. The hotel is extremely dated in it's decor, and although attempts seem to have been made over the years to modernize it visually, it ends up looking like a hodgepodge of styles from the 70's & 80's. The staff was always extremely friendly, especially at breakfast in the mornings, but to facilitate anything with the people at the front desk took forever as there was only one person who was ever working there. The rooms are large, although extremely dated, and the beds somewhat comfortable, although the air conditioning unit was extremely loud & blew cold air directly on the bed area when you were attempting to sleep. The bathroom had a built in vanity that looked like it was 30 years old, the stain worn off most of the cabinet, and the sink drain constantly gurgled. You always had to flush the toilet twice to remove all waste. The hair dryer wouldn't work the second day. And despite asking repeatedly for additional \regular\ coffee replacements in the room, they would always deliver decaffeinated .... that in itself was maddening. The last night I needed some bottled water (the water from the faucet in the room is terrible) so visited the gift shop where they charged me $8 for two standard bottles of arrowhead water. I just looked at the cashier incredulously and said, \You've got to be kidding me.\ He didn't even bother to respond.

1684,3.8,"Never, never, never going here again...Hearing complaining about tips is a HUGE turn off in my book. Upon entering Autumn Court the server/bartender was complaining to a man sitting at the bar that the last customers that she served did not leave her a tip. (To be honest, I would have considered stiffing her too after these comments.) She then had the audacity to ask the customer if she should go out and ask them for one! This is all while we were waiting to be seated. The customer said \I wouldn't\ and she made a dash for the side door heading to the parking lot. The customer turned to us and said he had never seen anything like that before. Wait...there's more. We turned around and left to find a different place to eat and I made a call to the manager to let him know what had happened. He listened, but offered no resolution and took my information to pass to the owner. Five minutes later my cell phone starts ringing and it is the server (seriously!?) we called about asking why we thought it was not right that she did that and told me that she had the RIGHT to tips because she was not paid hourly. I briefly spoke to her about the rudeness of speaking to customers about other customers and all she could say was that she would not get fired over this. Babe, if were my restaurant you would have totally have been gone for this. Tomorrow I'll try and contact the owner direct because we are never going there again and my phone number should not have been passed out like that.

1688,4.5,"I recently visited the Clarendon Kitchen for the first time. We went on a Sunday after church with about 6 people, myself included. The decor was great, kinda Va-to meets chic. And the urinals made out lips were stunning!!! That was the good.........Here's the bad........We were the only people in the restaurant and were seated immediately. So I had thought that quick service with our drinks and food would follow in the same foot steps.Boy was I wrong. The table only ordered 2 drinks for the bar, one Bloody Mary and one Mimosa. And with $8 dollar price tags each you can see why....ouch. After about 5 min the waitress brought out every ones coffee and water. about 5 min after that she brought the drinks from the bar. Remember the place is empty. I ordered the Chimichanga, and my bf ordered the patty melt. after about 30 min the chef came out and asked how everything was. We said \good except we do have our food yet\ He said I will go and check on it........Wait......didn't he say he was the chef? Maybe they have to when its so busy like this...........Finally when the food arrived, our waitress couldn't remember who got what. My Chimi was enormous in size but pretty mediocre in taste. My BF's Patty melt which he asked for rare come out well done.....oops, close i guess  We stated up front that everyone was on separate checks except my BF and I. When the checks came we had our own check but  everyone else's was together. When we told her she said it's alright I can ring them all, I remember what each of you got.......uh not likely, you couldn't even remember when you were bringing the food. So after about 2 min she came back and said I will just print out new separate bills. \Ya think?\ When she came back with those bills she had added the tip in, so now our bill was 8 dollars higher then when bill came out before. Cool whatever, at this point we are ready to run for the hills, it had been one dumb thing after another. When she brought out my friend Danny's change, she told him that they didn't have 19 cents so she just gave him a quarter. What? And after he looked at his bill he saw that he was actually owed 50 cents not 19. Can this girl not count or something? What else can she not do? 1. Remember what everyone got 2. keep drinks filled 3. listen. So all in all I might go back  but maybe only for a dip in the fabulous pool.

She asked if she could just switch it to a small cup of icecream and one of the Owners (don't know her name) literally threw (with more force than necessary)  the sandwich into the garbage can.  Awkward!  After my friend switched to plain icecream, the Owner asked \Did you try it before?\, sounding like the Owner didn't want to be burdened again with an exchange.

First off do not say you will try just go make it happen. Not asking you to do anything special. Secondly it is freaking western final game 6! After 30 min still on the wrong channel. Argg The meal comes out finally but my dates salad had dressing all over it and was asked to be put on the side. So I got the server attention (the one that couldn't change the channel) said there is dressing on the salad. The server made excuses saying that he put it in the system correct and the cook did it wrong. First off I do not care who did it just get it fixed and not a 30 min wait. The salad came back out and looked nice. Now the game has started according to my smart phone but still their tv wrong channel! So I ask another server to change to TNT for the game and she argued it was on ESPN. I was like WTF it is on TNT do you see any game on ESPN? She finally got the remote changed to TNT. Wow the game is on and half way through 2nd quarter. Positive note: The establishment was clean, the bathroom was clean, servers looked good (most of them fake boobs). Note for restaurant: If you make a mistake own up and get it fixed ASAP. If you have a bar know what key games are on TV.

1729,3.4,"Let's start with the positive:Cajun fries were pretty flavorful and fresh, neat red and white decor and I like the fact that true to the name \Five guys\, there were exactly 5 guys cooking the burgers lol.The choice of toppings were pretty good, much more than In & Out. You could choose grilled mushroom, grilled green pepper, onion, relish, A1 sauce, BBQ sauce, lettuce and other toppings you can think of.The negative:The patty did not melt in your mouth when i took a bite into it. The patty actually crumbled pretty fast, and was plain tasting. The bun was not that special either. For the relatively higher price for it's fast food burger, I was quite disappointed in it. I still think Shake Shack in New York and In & Out tastes alot better.",0zeTx6na,4452

My wife and I had their 2/$20 deal. Spinach & Artichoke appetizer was so-so. Not much flavor. My wife had the blackened chicken & penne pasta. She says it was \alright.\ (I made the same thing at home last week and mine was better) I had the chicken and shrimp skillet. The shrimps were small and just warm. they were probably cooked ahead and spooned on top later. The chicken breast was overcooked and dry. Served with fried red potatoes and a mushroom and onion stirfry, I hesitated to send it back fearing retaliation (if you know what I mean) on a different meal.

1737,1.5,"A few weeks back a couple of Yelp/Facebook friends made a big deal out of going here for lunch.  Well, not quite here but a location in Tempe.  The reviews looked good but that was too far for me to drive for lunch.  After checking the website it turns out the Mesa franchisee opened this location in February of 2008 right across the street from Glendale Community College.I got there right at midday and the place was over half full, mostly college kids but a few workers from the area too.  Things look to be in a bit of disarray but I think that is deliberate.  Because all of their sandwiches are toasted be prepared to wait for the bread to toast.I had an 8\ White Widow (chicken with ranch dressing and a bunch of other stuff) on garlic bread and a bowl of cheddar broccoli soup to which they added shredded cheese and mushrooms on top of.  It was all pretty good, toasting the sub roll first adds a bit of a nice twist to the standard sandwich shop. Total with a soda and tax was $9.86 and I was full.They could have done with a bit more often cleaning of tables and common areas, but this was lunch time with a younger crowd of customers. Overall I would say about 3.4.  I would definitely go again.",uzjsrgO3,3786
1738,5,"After reading the other Yelp reviews I planned to visit this restaurant, but then I saw a listing in one of those hotel guide magazines that described the cuisine as \standard Mexican food.\ Standard Mexican food bores me, but fortunately I decided to take a look at Garduno's online menu. Sure they have tacos and enchiladas, but they have a lot of interesting food as well, including 5 kinds of chili, lots of interesting seafood, and even some seafood gumbos. I had the house special gumbo, which included lobster, shrimp, and scallops, and it was wonderful. Nice and spicy, with fresh fish and lots of okra and other veggies. I also tried a couple of their margaritas. They were both good, but the better and more unusual one was a coconut margarita. It was smooth and coconutty, and the rim of the glass was coated with honey and toasted coconut. Yum!",91LqhhYh,3356
1739,2.8,"I'll preempt this review by stating that I have no concept of what authentic Korean food tastes like.  I've had a few home-cooked meals, but when it comes to Korean restaurants, my exposure is limited to Chuhgajib Korean BBQ and Takamatsu.  I personally don't care too much about food's authenticity, for me taste reigns supreme.  For example, I prefer artificial strawberry flavoring, but hate actual strawberries.That being said, I'm not well-traveled enough to tell you how authentic the food is.  All I can tell you is that it's always been a good experience and the food is very tasty.The atmosphere and staff are welcoming.  Some tables feature built-in grills so you can cook the meat at your table (it's fun once, but I'll let the cooks handle it next time).  As a former waiter, I would cringe if I had to babysit some guy trying to impress a girl by using the table-top grill.  But, on a recent date, the staff was more than helpful with doing just that.  Despite my best efforts I had a hard time finding the sweet spot between thinly sliced raw meat and charred ash, and I have a feeling other restaurants might have been less appreciative of me smoking up the place. :)  As a tragically un-hip white guy, I've been to a lot of ethnic restaurants where I've felt uncomfortable for being unfamiliar with the cuisine or customs of that region, and I never felt that way here.Like most Korean places, every meal is kicked off with a slew of mini appetizers, which I believe is called banchan. Some are fantastic, some are ok, and some I could skip out on (I'm not a fan of kimchi so I can't tell you if it's any good), but it's free so at the very least you can get a lot of different tastes even if you only order one item.As for the meals, I just stick to BBQ dishes.  The spicy bulgogi is my favorite, the meat tastes like it's infused with the seasoning, and it's got just he right amount of kick.  The regular bulgogi and the chicken are also good choices for your first visit, and they have a few combo deals so you can try different meats.  Avoid the pork, it was practically inedible, very chewy and fatty.One last note:  The boba drinks are ok, but consider getting one afterwards at Pho Avina next door, they have more flavors, warmed-up boba \balls\, and the sealed cups you have to stab with your straw.Other reviewers seem to think that the only reason this place is getting good reviews is that those reviewers have a limited perspective on Korean food, and that there aren't many options in Phoenix.  That might be true, but my guess is you wouldn't be reading this if you lived anywhere else, and if that's the case then your Korean food exposure is likely similar to mine and so are your options.  I'm sure there's better places out there, but you'd likely have to board a plane to find one.",llVE7aBr,2267

I usually sit at the outdoor seating during lunchtime and enjoy the sun.  The food can be a little pricey - but its huge portions that you can bring home for another meal.  I would def recommend this place.  The only downfall to sitting outside is that being right on Bethany Home Road - you do hear a lot of traffic.

1748,1.2,"In the movie \The 40-Year Old Virgin,\ there is a line they repeat often to Steve Carrell: \You're putting the pu$$y on a pedestal, that's your problem!\Matt's Big Breakfast was on a pedestal. We'd tried to go there a couple years ago, but the crowd outside was always too threatening a wait. Then, in August, we tried to go, but when we asked \What's the probable wait time?\ We were told, \Oh we don't really provide anyone with wait times.\ The line outside was pretty long, and there wasn't really any shade, and with no potential end to the wait, we came to terms with the possibility that we'd turn into bacon ourselves sitting outside waiting for a table. Then this morning I woke up at 6:30am on a Saturday due to insomnia and we said \Hey there might actually not be a line if we go right now.\I just came back from breakfast at Matt's Big Breakfast and now I'm waiting for my heart attack.I'd tried to find out what the big deal was about this greasy spoon so many times in reviews, and nobody ever gave a good explanation in detail of what makes the \traditional breakfast food\ so \different.\I ordered the special - which was an egg, cheese, onion and sausage omelette, with hash browns. Since it was our first time there, we also ordered a belgian waffle to split.The omelette was more like \Onion and Sausage with a side of egg and cheese.\ The sausage was giant sliced links, enough to feed an army. The amount of onion was not what I expected - it was probably two entire onions sliced up and thrown in there. The hash browns are a serving for 4 people or something. They're not sliced like ordinary hash browns are sliced - they're ultra skinny slices like angelhair pasta. There are a lot of really crunchy crispy areas of angelhair sliced hash browns which are tasty. Thankfully, they are not all salty. But what sort of human can ingest this much potato in one sitting?I'm one year away from having been a vegetarian for 5 years, and I was willing to \go there\ at this meal because I had to see what everyone was raving about, and I read on the menu that the meat is natural and grain-fed. Not free-range, grass-fed, but at least not corn-fed and hormonalized and antibiotic-ridden. Also, I eat burgers at Delux and Rokerij and I'll eat the prosciutto at Bomberos. So I thought, why not see what the fuss is all about?It was a'ight. Not FABULOUS. I tried to figure out why this place is SUCH a big deal to so many. Maybe it is shocking to some people's palates to taste food made with real butter and real cream - people who ordinarily cook at home and fill their cupboards with the healthy substitutes of every ingredient. Or maybe typical people buy Kraft cheese or something, I don't know. The ingredients were definitely \real,\ which is, I suppose, a big deal if you ordinarily eat Crap for breakfast or eat at Denny's. It most definitely beats \Moons Over My Hammy\ for instance.But we really missed Pallate, which really WAS the best breakfast downtown.The bread they brought for the toast was delicious ... but it's BREAD. Most bread is pretty good. The waffle was uber fluffy. I had a few bites and said \That's a tasty plate of diabetes right there,\ while I felt my blood sugar go through the roof.Mostly, I really felt a lack in the vegetables department. I might seem like a health nut, because of this, but trust me, I'm not. I'm a tall, big person and I eat breakfasts at Dick's Hideaway several times a week. It's just that at Dick's Hideaway I can have them substitute the potatoes for veggies (usually asparagus and broccoli), and substitute the meat in the breakfast burrito with avocado. I'm used to having an entire day's worth of greens at breakfast. I suppose meat, for me, is like dessert: I'll eat it but it has to be high quality, and it has to be really worth it. It has to be tremendously delicious, I won't eat meat for meat's sake. This was probably somewhat ethical meat, but it wasn't an irresistible herby or spicy delicious sensation.The \thick-cut bacon\ that came with the waffle was definitely thick, and was lined with pepper. It was good, but it was also bacon ... bacon SHOULD be good, it's hard to do bad.I see the trendy hipster appeal everywhere - orange countertops, orange everywhere, down to the stapler on the counter, the 1950's signs that say \Eggs!\ and stuff. Whatever. I get it, it's better than Denny's, and it's better than 5 & Diner. It's NOT \The Best\ and it's most definitely not worth standing around outside in no shade, without any idea how long the wait will be for a table, like a sucker.The chalkboard on the wall inside says \Visit our bar The Roosevelt around the corner.\ I hadn't known they own the Roosevelt. I recommend going to the Roosevelt and waiting around for a seat there, where it's worth the wait.I'm glad I finally went, to knock the place off its pedestal. Now I just need to wait like a month or something for my arteries to un-clog.",mNuaXrUf,1736
1749,3.8,"Drove past this place the other night and made a note to stop by and check it out. Well tonight's the night. I must say that it's a modest, nicely laid out location with a small but good selection. That's about where the fun ends though. It hasn't been often that I've walked into a cigar shop (almost anywhere for that matter) where I haven't felt welcomed, but I have to say, this is one of those shops. I'm not sure if it's because of the great time I just had at Majerle's or if I was interrupting the game (which I came in to watch) but I simply \wasn't feeling the love.\I smoked an Arturo Fuente Hemmingway which was perfectly moist and relaxed with my iPad for most of my visit. The clerk (proprieter?) literally said three words to me the whole time \cigar?,\ \$9.99\ and \Thanks.\  No offers of joining the rest of the guys, where you from?, what do you like to smoke?, not even \Do you want to smoke here? Need matches, etc\ Although the guy after me at least got the last question. All in all, a pretty disappointing visit. Selection was ok, but I can find that anywhere along with a bit of camaraderie. Therefore I'll take my business and friends elsewhere next time. If you decide to check it out, I hope you have a more enjoyable time.",9MuNFbcd,1842

After reading the negative reviews and a few salient 5 star reviews I can surmise this: This is NW west coffee done in the desert. Get used to it!I lived in Portland OR and was fueled by Stumptown coffee. Four Barrel is its little cousin, or are they sisters? Competitive brothers?

Standard quality fare for the rice and beans, while the enchilada I consider to have been above average in taste.Didn't experience any issues with service delays or the food itself and prices aren't bad.

1780,4.8,"The best way I can express myself on this restaurant is frustration.  This place was soooo close of having it done right, but just missed the mark and here is why.I don't know, maybe it's because I'm Asian or maybe because I'm a chow-hound at heart, but I like my ethnic foods \ethnic\ and \real\.  I am not insinuating this place isn't, but I don't like my food to be slightly \watered down\ so the masses can enjoy.  Unfortunately Noodles Ranch ever so slightly muted out what wonderful flavors Vietnam has to offer for what I believe, is pleasing the \Scottsdale\ crowd.This is how I came up with that conclusion: 1. there egg rolls and fish sauce, 2. the place was way too clean for a Vietnamese restaurant, and 3. I was the only Asian patron.Like your typical Vietnamese style egg rolls, it came out nice and warm with that crispy skin you expect, unfortunately I thought the filling was a little on the bland side.  Also, I thought it was slightly oily for a fried egg roll.  A paper towel would have taken care of that.  But it needed some help with a little more salt and pepper.  No bold flavors coming out from there.It came with your standard lettuce, a few herbs, julienne pickled carrots, and a few raw bean sprouts.  They were all fresh as they should be, but it was the fish sauce that started to get me thinking they might be \watering down\ the food.  I don't know about you, but I'm used to slightly salty, slightly sweet, sour/tangy, fishy fish sauce with pepper flakes and julienne sweet and sour pickled carrots and dikon.  Their version was saltier than usual, did not have the pepper flakes and julienne pickled carrots.  The sauce wasn't very fishy either.  Very bland, almost catering towards the Scottsdale people in the area.The Pho, was status quo.  Nice and warm beef broth with all the goodies such as sliced beef tenderloin, Vietnamese style meatballs, tripe, and other goodies, totally hits the spot on a rainy AZ winter day.   The noodles were roughly 5 minutes overcooked.  They broke apart too easily and I wish they would have given just a little bit more of the sliced beef tenderloin.  One of the owners did ask me if I wanted more soup even before I started which was a nice gesture, I just wish they would have given me more up front.The middle aged couple who owned the restaurant were extremely nice and the service was great, especially for a Vietnamese restaurant.The decor was very tasteful, bright colorful Vietnamese umbrellas dressed the ceiling.  I was impressed by the openness of the restaurant with its high ceilings.  The walls were attractively dressed with dark purple and muted blue with large black and white photos of old Vietnam, probably mid 20th Century, with an assortment of bamboo sticks and other trinkets from the \old country.\  The only thing I couldn't't get over were the booths which lined the side walls of the restaurant with stripes of this sparkly, metallicy electric blue and sandy tan color that dressed the booths.  I must say that I enjoyed the fact that the restaurant was so clean.  Unfortunately when it comes to Vietnamese restaurants, it seems the dirtier and dingier the restaurant, the better the food.For Vietnamese food , it was priced high, probably anywhere from $1.00 to $1.50 higher per dish.  That probably has more to do with reflection of rent than anything else.Last thing why I believed this place was a little \watered down\; I was the only Asian patron during their lunch rush.  As many of my friends have said (White, Black, and Brown), \You know how I know what Asian restaurants are good...The ones with all you Asians in it.\   Enough said my brothas from different mothas.I'm not saying I won't come back here, because I will, but when I want the real thing, you know where I'm going, where my Asian peoples are at...my dirty dingy Khai Hong in Tempe.",uFvS7ITL,2907
1781,2.9,"Have been to Blue 32 three times.  I love a good sports bar, and it is close to home.  Hopefully the service will get better.  Our waitress told us she was sorry for the delay, but they were \getting busy\ - maybe a third of the booths were filled.  She didn't come by to fill water, check on us and took forever to get a beer and glass of wine to the table.  This was the first pre-season Cardinals game, so they should have been prepared for customers.  The food is really good - but be warned, it is heart attack food.  I have eaten at the bar and received better service.  One more item that drives me crazy in a sports bar:  there were a lot of babies crying and dirty looks sent over to tables getting loud with guys yelling profanities that young kids probably shouldn't be around.  I'm not putting it on Blue 32 to get involved, but perhaps they should ask that mom or dad take the baby into the restroom to calm down and give the other patrons a good sportsbar experience.",XJN9NF4k,135
1782,3.1,I do not see why people are so quick to judge an IHOP so harshly.It's an IHOP for Pete's sake. The service is ok for being a chain breakfast place. But it is nice that this location is 24hours because my friends and I need a place to eat whether it be after bar hopping hours or not.The food is consistantly not too bad (again for a chain) and I've gone back several times.

I was there for a short amount of time during my first visit and my eyes were shooting around the store at all of the adorable clothing.  I didn't have a chance to take a good look at the collection of dresses but I definitely liked what I saw.  I did look though much of their tshirt and other blouses and ended up with a really cute black top to add to my collection.  They also had some great shoes and super cute jewelry.  It is on the expensive side,qzhvP4kv,2434

1795,2.4,"This is one of the best places and by walking in the door you can tell there is no secret about this place. It is awesome and again I sit at the bar a lot because then I don't have to wait in line. This is real therapeutic because I am realizing that I am just a spoiled brat and just don't like waiting in line, I want to just be seated. Anyway, the food is great, prices are just as great and the food portions are awesome too. I am 6'3\ 260 pds. with an athletic build, so I can afford big portions cause I burn most of it off. I will get off of my soapbox and finish. Great job at MiMi's all of them are great.",RNYuqYG1,2371
1796,2,"I've been to Celsius a number of times and I've always enjoyed the food. The service has been uneven from time to time but I usually am at the Sushi Bar and when ever I'm at the Sushi bar, I meet new people and I guess I forget about how long my meal is taking. Don't get me wrong, this is a big part of my experience, that is the \art of service\. But again, for some reason, the Sushi bar is to meet new people and time does not seem to matter. They have a great assortment of sushi and sashimi and Joe C the owner has always been attentive to me as well as suggesting items from the menu. He has a comprehensive menu and it describes all the items and I find that helpful. I also think the price is right. Let's be honest here....Sushi is expensive. Try it, I think you will like it.",ZWGDEsim,2656
1797,1.4,"As you walk in you are greeted by very friendly hostesses and the smell of bonfire- yes, they really took it there.  My friends and I sat at the bar and was served by very friendly bartenders.  My friends, who had been there for over an hour, were raving about the food and said it was bah-nan-ahs, so I had to try it...and I was starving.  I ordered the Grilled Cheese Skewers- they come with bacon and who doesn't love bacon?!  My food was brought out very quickly and I was stoked, until I ate it.  The bacon, bread and cheese were good but they put \roasted tomatos\ on it as well and they were terrible. I did try the meatballs which were okay.  The meat was good but it tasted like they were covered in, what tasted like, spicy ketchup. I will definitely go back for the atmosphere and the very friendly service but I'm not so sure I'll be eating their food.",6KnMsqhk,3513

I was wrong..  =  /Maybe I was expecting little too much or perhaps person who was cooking that day was mad at the world and decided to take out his anger on the burger by smashing it!!   Because my burger looked like someone got confused between cooking the juicy burger and beef jerky.    I mean, it was so dry, it reminded me of my friend's 4th of July BBQ party!  Really? Do I must experience that all over again?I am sure I was one of the hundreds who got the bad burger of the day.. If they had a section of the wall saying, \Hall of shame burger\ and I would be on it.. Oh boy was it terrible!But during my second visit.  Burger wasn't too bad, but still didn't satisfied my taste bud.   All I tasted was.. average burger at average burger shop with average price for average service..  Maybe I am not your average guy?

I ordered a \crisp, clean, NOT sweet\ Rose, but he then returned and said it was not available, could he substitute another Rose?  I said as long as it was def. not sweet, he said indeed it wasn't.   Was the worst bottle of wine I've ever had.  (I know, I shoudl have sent it back, long story...)Anyhow, the server at the show was amazing: fun, happy, quick, accomodating.

I got there around 11 with some friends and it still took us about 10mins to get a drink.  The only part that i liked about this place. was the waitress that i talked to for most of the night. Luckily her manager was somewhat stupid because i was able to keep her at my table for about 20min without him knowing before getting her #.

1815,1.5,"Italian Restaurant, the generically named eatery from James Beard Award-winner Chris Bianco, is scheduled to open its doors Monday, Jan. 16, 4 o'clock, in the Town and Country Shopping Center, around the corner from Trader Joes. They were right on time.Chef Claudio, the mercurial boss of the kitchen Italian Restaurant is outside his door to meet and greet just a few folks before he begins his voodoo that he does so well. He shakes my hand and we introduce.The Tuscany dining room is an old world stage. Fired candlesticks light the walls. Framed pieces of art hang with pride. There is an energy about, that certainly is a tribute to mama, and the \food we grew up with.\I sit at the bar as a gentleman is finishing \home movies\ of the guest arriving. Tom becomes my server. He is wearing a Claddagh ring. His is in the marriage position. I have one too, I wear mine in the prowling position. I order a drink and Tom brings me red wine from Dos Cabezas Wineworks in glassware you would see at the Italian family table. As a footnote I have been to a blessing of the harvest at this Southern Arizona Vineyard. These Festivals are surreal. Mine included monsoon storms in the distance while walking in the vineyard at night with my date. You can taste the love that goes in this table wine. First on the menu is antipasti. I decide to have Pecorino Di Fossa. 6. This is a hard, flaky sheep's milk cheese that you must hold on your tongue resisting to bite for as long as you can. A cheese that has been aged in caves for four months, indeed subterranean holes that occur naturally in the Northern Italian landscape of this area, and they are the source of Pecorino di Fossa's complex flavor and aroma.It is time for Chef Claudio to fire my Organic Kamut Grain Spaghetti. 14. Chef has been making pasta longer than anything else, so the choice is simple. Server Sidney announces spaghetti and serves me from the left. I look over to her and with the sparkle in her eyes and lovely smile, I'm shot through the heart.I have an order of Pane Bianco bread to mop my sauce and work my pasta. I taste  slight heat in the sauce from Contorni Peppers. The dish is just perfect.I finish with a cafe solo in a demitasse cup and a cube of sugar on a demi spoon.Bottom line I spent 48 dollars for two glasses of wine, cheese and cherries, spaghetti and bread, and a cup of espresso. And one last note, tell your server how long to wait to fire your entree, if your in a rush say so, if you want to slow it down to enjoy your experience with your date, say it. And the smaller portions are in line with rising high quality organic ingredient costs.",rxRiYQVb,208
1816,2.9,"Had dinner here on our last night of our \staycation\ at Squaw Peak back in July. I had the meatloaf which was a little too burnt for my taste, but my wife's ribeye tasted pretty good. Pretty fast service although the restaurant was only half full. Our server gave us both the kids-eat-free discount plus the military discount.  Kudos to him, but I forgot his name. My only gripe was the wait to be seated. The hostess told us around 30 min wait because alot of parties had just arrived. She asked us if we wanted to wait. We said yes, obviously. So we sat in the lounge with 2 loud twin 2 yr old boys. 15 min later we were seated. Did I mention the place was half full? Was the hostess hoping we would not hang out and maybe take my kids somewhere else?  Who knows... but they lost a star for that.",m01ZSsHT,3

It's delicious.But it's also in Chandler. I think. Gilbert? Edge of Mesa? I don't really know, but what I do know is that the corner of Dobson and Warner requires that I cross both the 101 and the 60. Both of them. In one trip. I was tired just thinking about it. Instead: Arai Pastry. Japanese sandwiches. Not the same as bahn mi, no, no at all. But it was Euro-Asian goodness, and that's what mattered.Spicy teriyaki chicken topped with a slice of American cheese (wha?), spicy mayo (not \chili aoili,\ mind you -- Arai is not that kind of place), jalapenos, lettuce and tomato. On a nice big wheat baguette. Spicy. Random. Delicious. And thanks to good ole American ethnocentrism, my stomach is more than happy to lump all Asian sandwiches together under the same umbrella.

Joey was very attentive and nice. he made me 2 random ass drinks. i told him to surprise me (since i can hold my alcohol VERY VERY well) the drinks he made were sooo yummy. he definately deserve a raise. i will be asking for joey to make my drinks the next time im in town =],P5voEKXf,4585

1831,4.8,"I came here yesterday for a SpaGirls event. The normal $35 blowdry was $25. Located in the Scottsdale Quarter, I parked in the south garage which was just off the side street Drybar was located. It didn't take me long to locate it and it was a very short walk from the garage. The decor was light and nicely done. On Saturdays and Sundays,they have champagne and dessert until 2pm so I had a couple of mimosas during my time there. My appt was at 2pm but they got me in 15 minutes early which was nice. When they took me back, Christine washed my hair and talked to me about the conditioning shot for my hair. For $20, it is supposed to last for 6 weeks. I thought, why not, since summer is coming and my coarse hair is about to get drier. I asked Christine to do what I think is called \Straight Up\ which is stick straight. Since my hair is really thick, it took her awhile but she did a fantastic job! I have honestly never seen my hair look this good. My girlfriend went too and I never saw her curly hair look that good straight. She had her ends curled whereas I did mine all straight but both of our hair looked awesome. When I got home and went to work, I received many compliments. I felt the staff was very friendly and I would definitely go back. They have packages like 3 blowdrys for $100 which saves some $. I wouldn't go to Drybar all of the time but for a girl with curly hair, it is a nice indulgence to have someone blowdry and style it straight for me. Love it!!",BZGMTlg3,3527

So I'm not so crazy about who I'm sharing my meal with, but if the meal is good, I am down with it. Service ain't to shabby - not the best, they seem ocassionally bothered that they have to take your order or that you're not entirely sure what you want, but when you give a person a multitude of ways to make things, you're gonna ask, is this gluten-free, is this dairy-free, etc. You'd think they'd be use to those questions by now.

1838,2.5,"Sandwiches are my thing.  I want to eat as many of them as possible from as many different places as I can.  And let me tell you, there is just something about the sandwiches from Cheese 'n Stuff.It's not big on atmosphere.  There's a deli counter and then a few picnic tables with plastic tableclothes, some shelves stocking Swedish foodstuffs for sale as well as the store's backstock of chips, soda and paper towels.  They usually have some cheesy holiday decorations out.  It's cramped and not that pleasant.  I usually get my lunches to go.Their sandwich menu consists of about a million pages printed out from an inkjet printer and taped to the wall, along with some hokey signs that say things like \Today's Special: So's Tomorrow.\  There's nothing slick or pretentious about it.  It's obviously just a shop owned by some guy and his wife and daughter.So yeah.  The sandwiches.  I'm a vegetarian, and they have a simple yet elegant veggie sandwich that I find myself craving a lot.  It has cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, avocados, and some kind of dressing.  I get it on a wheat sub roll.  Not fancy, but oh-so-tasty.  I wish they had more veggie options, but this one satisfies me.I bring friends who eat meat here so I can tell them to order the Doughboy and enjoy it vicariously.  Their deli meat is high quality and there are loads of options.  It looks like the sort of place my grandpa would love and I want to bring him there some day.  No one I've brought in has been disappointed.The sides are delicious.  I am a fan of the macaroni salad and the pasta salad that has the olives and italian dressing.  If I'm feeling indulgent, I'll get a brownie, a piece of cheesecake, or an ice-cold sarsaparilla.The lack of atmosphere doesn't bother me; my one gripe with this place is how early they close.  There have been many times I haven't gotten moving early enough and haven't been able to get there before they close, which is 4 PM.

I asked him to take me to a place unique to Scottsdale, and he brought me here.We sat outside on a beautiful evening.  Temperature was perfect and the restaurant had a great overall \vibe.\The food was really, really good.  I had the crab stuffed chiles (i forgot the name, but you can figure it out), which were the best I've ever had.  The chiles were deep fried and had this wonderful sauce on it.  A great dish.they also have a unique prickly pear margarita (i'm not sure if it's unique to the restaurant or unique to the area) which tastes kind of like guava.I'll definitely be coming back to this place!",dk0K1AU0,3784

1842,2.4,While I feel Yelpers have overrated the Princess let me preface my review by saying that I stayed here last November for a week when they were under renovation.  While I didn't ask if they were under construction when I made the reservation no one offered me that information.   Despite being in relatively high season the place was essentially empty.  My room was large and comfortable but needed updating and faced the parking lot.  Often noisy in the AM with employees arriving and construction people.  Room was quite far to central part of hotel with long walk to central pool and restaurants.  Normally I wouldn't mind but with the construction the place was like a maze with unmarked dead end corridors and paths.  A good portion of the property was fenced off.   I felt like a rat in a maze at times.  I ate at the the high end Mex restaurant on property which was good,URRs1ak4,1284
1843,2.3,"I'm really teeter toddling where to go with this review...Do I review the restaurant?Do I review the service?Do I review the atmosphere?Or do I simply review the entire experience?This is a hard pressed 3 star review, because although our entire experience here was incredible (AKA Fiance's Parents took us here  for our engagement celebration) in all actuality that's really the best this location is REALLY worth. First off Mastro's, your food is literally crack, and I mean literally. Your Lobster mashed potatoes, your steaks and your \Why Thank you I'll be a fatass and order the butter cake\ dessert are AMAZING. Here's why I'm taking two stars off you...1. Your decor, although glowing neon red was cool in the 80's, having the bar illuminated with it reminds some of us of the movie \Cocktail\ and that's not in a good way. 2. I shouldn't have to say this but, Scottsdale, you haven't changed. So minus a star for all the backwards baseball hat wearing, rude, shouting, 30,000 dollar millionaires that jammed the dining room, also minus heavy points in my book for the guy wearing the cubic zirconium encrusted \VERSCE\ sunglasses inside, (and yes, they were spelled that way too).

1846,4.1,"I went here on a Sunday night with my girlfriend looking to get a drink and some food. It was a bit later, a little past 10 pm, so when we walked in we asked the bouncer if they were still serving food. He told us they were, so we decided to check it out. It was pretty empty, with less than ten people in the entire place. First, we sat down at the bar at the first floor for a few minutes and could not find either a bartender or a server so we went upstairs. We sat at the round bar where there was a young female bartender putting stuff away and setting up. We waited for at least ten minutes while she was doing this. She didn't make eye contact or say anything to us even though we were literally sitting less than two feet from her. Finally, I asked if we could get a couple menus. She rudely said something like \Uh, we don't serve food past ten\ then walked away. And so did we. I get it if you don't serve food late, but don't have your bouncer tell us you do. Also, if people come into your dead establishment looking to spend their money, maybe you should make some sort of effort to treat them like human beings. I can't wait until this place closes down and a new bar/grill opens that actually wants people to come in.Upper Deck: I award you no stars, and may God have mercy on your soul.",NslrrMuM,157

1848,4.2,"This is the best place to get hotdogs in the Phoenix area! This is a transplant of a small Buffalo,NY hotdog chain.  The meat is flown in several times a week from Buffalo.  The dogs are great! The Weber's mustard is also a local Buffalo condiment. Don't forget the Ted's sauce on your dog too. It's basically a combination of ketchup with slightly spicey tomato relish. You can also get a foot long or a \jumbo\ (really thick) hotdog. The \Jumbo\ burgers are great too.  They serve Polish and Italian sausage too.  The onion rings are a great side.  You know the food is great here because there's always a line.                Be prepared to order your dogs, burgers etc while standing in line.  Don't  be one of those people that holds the line up by not having a clue what you want. If you've never been there before, read the menu posted above the grill area. You don't have to tell them the toppings you want until you reach the cash register area and your stuff is cooked.  After your order your dogs they will ask you if you want any fries or rings,  then later they will ask what you want to drink.  This type of ordering confuses some people.  It keeps the line moving, so play along and enjoy some great dogs!

The service was good, in fact, we felt that our server took good care of us,  but the food was Blah to be kind.This place needs to figure out what it wants to be. If they want to be a bar, then the terrible food is fine, but if they want to be a returant, there needs to be way more quality control in the kitchen. I ordered the grilled flat iron steak ordered medium and I got a seared piece of meat completely cool (RAW) in the middle. So I politely pointed out that this meat was still able to MOOO and requested that it be brought up to temp. It came back a couple of minutes later only to be seared some more with now a rare, at best, middle. I gave up; I really wasn't interested in having a hockey puck piece of meat left after another re-fire. The plate also consisted off what they call a baked cheddar potato which in all reality is some kind of stringy shredded potatoes (Hash browns)  with some creamy cheese concoction on them then they were broiled for a few seconds to crust up the outside. They were very weird, their flavor was almost that of boxed au gratin potatoes and their consistency was that of the inside of a tater tot. In Fact (BREAKTHROUGH) I just came up with a great name for them other than Baked Cheddar Potatoes,,,,,,Wait for it,CHEESY SHREDDED TOTTSAlso note, when ordering the Taproom steak sandwich, what they forget to mention on the menu is that it's an open faced sandwich which can be fine if you know that going in, but we had to ask for a top for the sandwich because there is absolutely no mention of it...Sorry, I wanted a sandwich, not a piece of meat on bread...",xvNoWEpN,3088
1858,4.1,"I used to love Frontier, back in the Tech Boom era of late 1990s. They were a low cost airline back then, had fun people working for them, a check-in office at a hotel in Boulder, CO where you could park for free for as long as your trip was, check in your bags thru security, and got a free bus ride to DIA too. Then the boom went bust and 9/11/01 and next thing your know, Frontier has closed the Boulder office and all those nice amenities went away too. Since then, I have only flown Frontier a handful of times and each time has left me wondering why I bothered. Their planes feel like they are falling apart. They have squished many rows closer together in the back half of the planes, forcing taller people to pay more for the rows up front or pay less and try to squeeze in to the econo sections. People over 6' tall are really uncomfortable!  I do like their seats' headrests and how they curl to hold one's head upright, but they don't recline as far back as I'd like so I can sleep. There's other problems with the seat rows being so close together... when the person in front of me reclines his/her seat back the tiny amount they can, I can't get to my bag or purse under their seat at all; also I can't focus on the tiny TV screens at all anymore, seat in front reclined or not. The seats have no lumbar support at all in them. I'm a short person (5'2\) and I feel very uncomfortable in them. My back was aching badly after only a 1.5 hour flight.Then there is the carry on bag issue... the bag I normally carry onboard is very small really, and easily fits under the seats of every other airline, but it won't fit under Frontier's seats because the rows are too !*%*& close together to maneuver it to slid underneath the seat in front of me. So, I have to stand on an isle seat to put it overhead! What a joke!  Normally, I can carry on both my small bags by putting my purse inside the smaller of the two, but not on Frontier.I hate that every booking means I get an email a week or two before the flight with a time change for all the flight. This last trip was no different. I didn't actually have to worry about the flight from Denver to St. Louis being 30 minutes later, since I got the email about it and I was still arriving early afternoon, but on the return flight I got no text, no call and no email telling me my flight was delayed by 45 minutes. I was running late though, so it actually saved me from not having my small checked bag make the flight too, since I knew I couldn't carry it on, even though, as I said before, I can on all other airlines I fly. The flight was sold out and I knew this time my tiny carry on would have to go up top and not underneath, so I didn't put my reading material in it, but for the love of God, $20 to check a bag each way? The only reason I had booked this trip on Frontier was because I preferred the departure and arrival times over Southwest's. The cost was about equal, even with Frontier's checked bag fees. However, I don't think I'll bother flying them again, unless I have no other choice.",olJnjnHy,1630

I would say it was flavorful, but my tastebuds were so numb after the chicken, I couldn't tell.However, I did enjoy everything else!  The bread that comes with your meal is a \festival\ on the menu, but it's darn good... and perhaps the thing to save you should the jerk chicken be too much.  I ordered the shrimps on the side of my jerk chicken, but I think I just got trigger happy.  One dish and and appetizer is already plenty, so if the waitress suggests a side of shrimp, I say pass.Definitely get the plaintain avocado spring rolls.  Interesting texture and taste, plus the mango salsa on the side is quite refreshing.  Speaking of refreshing, I highly recommend the Sorrel to drink.  It's a hibiscus tea and rum blend, but you can't even taste the rum!  Mmm, perfect way to beat the Phoenix heat.Cute little restaurant with brightly colored walls, which is a welcome change from the red, brown and tan buildings outside.

1877,4.8,"It's been two weeks since we had dinner here.  Our waitress Alicea suggested ordering two items from the special birthday menu and the dessert is on the house.  The special menu is for a limited time with entrees not offered on the regular menu. For our appetizer we ordered the pork satay. Three huge, tender juicy pieces of pork got our taste buds off to a yummy start. My husband's entree, the \Evil Jungle Princess\ made with Filet Mignon and a peanut red curry sauce is on the regular menu. He enjoyed every bite...so did I. The red curry sauce is spicy spicy on the tongue, though a sip of the \Thai Mai\ frozen drink was a quick fix. And speaking of this drink, it's a must to order.  (Much better flavors than the traditional Mai Tai.) I ordered from the special birthday menu. My entree was called \Crispy Whole Fish\. As a waiter delivered it to our table the other diners heads turned with curiosity. It was a huge Red Snapper and yes the head, tail and fins still in tack! Every bite of the fish was perfectly moist. We forced ourselves to finish the Snapper since it was so scrumptious! This entree needs to be offered on the regular menu. The vegetable fried rice was fluffy and tasty with a hint of spiciness. (It wasn't oily like other Asian/Thai restaurants here in the valley make their rice.) The second side dish ordered was the wasabi mashed potatoes which was a perfect complement to both of our delicious entrees. And last was the complimentary dessert.....the Chocolate Volcano with vanilla bean ice cream.  We had our waitress box it up since we were full from eating all of the above food. This dessert can be ordered from the regular menu.  At home, later in the evening, we ate the Volcano. A great dessert, it was not to sweet.

My daughter who usually voraciously devours all noodles refused to finish the Alfredo. My wife ordered the eggplant Parmesan and was also disappointed.

1883,2.7,"I've not stayed at this resort, but have been here twice; once for a wedding and the other for a Lunch & Learn event.  Valet service each time was quick and the guys were professional and pleasant.  The grounds of the resort are kept meticulously clean and there were clear skies and greenery everywhere I looked; so beautiful.Lunch & Learn (Aug 18th):The event started a little past noon and ended a little past 3pm.  We reserved for six, but it's based on a first come, first served basis.  Two of us arrived a little after 11:30am and after paying our respective $75 fee, went to find a table that would afford us good views of the chef's station.  Unfortunately the best tables (with direct views of the chef's station) had \Reserved\ placards on them, so we ended up with one off to the right of the chef's station.  I would recommend arriving early to grab good seats; tables are set for ten.  There are two large TV screens in the room, in case you're not able to see the chef directly.  Our event was hosted by Chef MacMillan (gave the guests a few good laughs), with featured guest chef Kevin Binkley (owner of Binkley's Restaurant in Cave Creek).  The servers weren't obtrusive and kept our water and wine glasses full.  We started off with a glass of champagne, which wasn't great, but was appreciated and added to the festive ambiance.  For this event, we were served three courses:  an appetizer (chilled cucumber soup), entr\u00e9e (two-wash ranch chicken), and dessert (huckleberry semi-fredo).  Each course was paired with a different glass of wine:  John Anthony Sauvignon Blanc (white, appetizer), Andre Brunel Cote du Rhone (red, entr\u00e9e), and Pietro Rinaldi Moscato d'asti (dessert).  I'm not usually a fan of Sauvignon Blanc (I favor Riesling), but the John Anthony won me over.  Chef Binkley went over his background and demonstrated the process that goes with making the chilled cucumber soup (which is quite involved).  The soup, albeit a bit salty, was SO good.  Everyone raved about it, and the best part of the dish for me was the charred red onion.  The two-wash ranch chicken entr\u00e9e was good overall; however, my chicken was a bit dry and tough to cut.  This might be a one-off thing since others at the table said their chicken was moist.  Loved the sweet potato puree and Chantrell mushrooms.  The only real complaint I had was the lack of a demo for the entree and dessert.  With that said, I can understand why the chef needed to be in the kitchen...after all, we needed to eat, right? ;POther highlights:*  Live band entertained with great hits (a bit loud though for lunchtime)*  Recipes to take home*  Q & A with the chef (and photo ops)*  Raffles for a few prizes, which two of my friends won (a gift box of caramel brownies and one-night stay at the Sanctuary with dinner)Wedding (Friday, March 23rd):The ceremony was held at 5pm on the grounds near the ballroom.  The weather was a bit warm, but not unbearably so.  The bride and groom were beautiful (so was the service), but it was a bit distracting to see people observing us from the windows of the Jade Bar, which overlooked the grounds where the ceremony was held.After the ceremony, we took a short hike up the stairs for cocktail hour, held just outside the ballroom.  It was such a beautiful experience to have a glass of wine, nibble on hors d'oeuvres, chat with friends, and watch the sun go down (with the mountains as a backdrop).The reception was held in the ballroom and was decorated beautifully.  The food was great, the wine and alcohol was flowing, and the live (Latin) band made for a great evening.

1886,3.1,"Cheap Beer.  Strip Mall Bar.  Big open space and tables.  Tons of small TV's with no sound.Tasty, greasy bar food.I came here on a Thursday night.  Beer seemed really cheap... clearly this is a great place to go if you want to drink with friends for not a lot of money.  I had a microbrew bottle special for $2.50, for example, that was delicious.Because everyone raved about the wings, I tried some (Jess Jess, $9.50 for a dozen).  I felt, like many do, that they are not \saucy\ enough.  Almost no sauce.  But they are good.  Not great, not otherworldly, and not the best I've had in Phoenix.  But they are good, fair priced, and worth ordering if you are drinking beer and looking for an appetizer.I ordered the Candlestick Carver, recommended by many.  It was good.  Decent to good cuts of roast beef on sourdough (texas toast like) bread, with melted cheese and roasted peppers.  Here's a hint:  ASK FOR NO MAYO.  I like Mayo, but they put like 5 tablespoons on, and it kind of ruined it, and with the dipping au jus suace, you don't need it.I finished mine, enjoyed every bite, was stuffed, and ate a few of the curley fries (these are just the cheap frozen premade stuff you find at most restaurants).My son ate the Mac & Cheese.  I didn't try, but it looked fine.Anyway, will I be back?  Perhaps.  It's kind of a dive.  Parking is fine.  Serivce was nice.  Beer selection and pricing is the strength of this restaurant.  Food was good for a bar, maybe great.But this isn't a gastropub.  Not gourmet.  Check those expectations at the bar.I'd think this is a great place to go with a group of coworkers for happy hour.  Or a guys night out.  It's casual enough for the family if you are looking for greasy food.Order the wings.  But don't expect best of Phoenix.  Just expect solid wings.If I was coming here again with just one other person, I'd likely try a different appetizer to share, order a couple of their cheap beers, and probably eat their Buffalo Chicken sandwich to get the flavor of the buffalo wings without all the fatty skin.And I'd go home a pretty content man after signing the bill.",wDkH7FgY,2982

1889,2.8,I've only had one arrival and departure at the Phoenix airport and found it to be fairly delightful. I didn't have problems with long walks to my gate as other travelers,AEXKVuce,4577
1890,4.9,"I have to add an addendum to my review of 2/27/12.  After posting to Yelp.com, I also took my concerns to Olive Garden corporate.  I emailed my experience and concerns.  Within 48 hours I received a personalized email response as well as a phone call from corporate.  They were very understanding and validated my concerns.  5 hours after the call from corporate, I received a personal call from the manager of the Surprise Olive Garden apologizing for the situation.  I have to say, the quick response and feeling that my concerns were taken seriously makes me re-evaluate the restaurant and chain as a whole.  I really believe they will strive to make their \to go\ experience better.I definitely recommend the restaurant and giving their 'to go\ a chance.  Their food is good and I do believe that their food handling will improve  after this correspondence.",8RBFd7G6,3443
1891,4.2,This place is okay. I really liked the Crunchy Spicy Tuna. It's fried rice cakes with spicy tuna on top. The seared ahi tuna  dinner was not good at all. I barely had a couple bites. It was very tough and overcooked. Definitely more than seared. It might have been better if it was thinly sliced for me. Our server was very nice and came back often to refill our water glasses.50% off some appetizers and sushi (including the Crunch Spicy Tuna) makes this place worthwhile during happy hour which lasts until 7pm.Don't come here if you don't like loud music! Seems like they're trying to be a club as well as restaurant.,Uxurgym4,175
1892,1.6,When is Yelp going to let me award half stars,RpHQwtRP,3549
1893,4.1,Stepping into this establishment is like stepping into New England on the coast.  This place is so charming,N88li4vs,3526
1894,1.6,Looking for some unique cheeses?  It's about time places like this pop up into this town.  PF shares a corner with D'licious Dishes and combines selective american artisan cheeses with some charcuterie.The staff are friendly and helpful and you'll most likely find something that tickles your fancy.  Tried some interesting flavored american cheddars and picked up some local goat feta.    Along with your cheese pick up a baguette,J2ec91eK,631
1895,1.1,Friend asked me if I wanted to go out on Sat night and if so where to,JwKfc0eU,800
1896,4.7,I like and trust Dr. Ganem and intend to continue with him as long as I am in the area or at least as long as he is on my insurance.He has a relaxed yet direct and honest communication style that is very refreshing.  In my several visits with the good doctor and his staff I have had overall good experiences and I would recommend him.At this point I am docking from 5 stars based on what can best be considered a glitch in the administration of prescriptions and samples as executed through the support staff at the practice.  This resulted in my taking medication with undesirable side-effects...a medication which was apparently not the first choice for my needs.,BlJBQujQ,3230
1897,3.8,"5 stars. Phoenix is becoming more and more like a \real city.\First of all, I ride the light rail to and from work 5 days a week. It's on time, air-conditioned and remarkably clean. The Tempe kids are harder on it than the transients who invariably use it to cool off downtown.Parking at the airport is a thing of the past.Dinner downtown or in Tempe? Have as much wine as you want. You've got a sober driver until well after the bars close (on the weekends, at least). If they ever get a line out to Scottsdale, it's over. I'd sell my car. Bottom line: if you can use the light rail, you should. It's convenient, fast and environmentally responsible. Support it now and encourage expansion.",3C2m73bT,636
1898,3.6,"After reading about this place here on Yelp, I decided it was time to wander into this marvelous establishment once and for all, and check it out.   I was in the market to purchase a book, and thought why not wander in here to see if they had it or not.I arrived, and immediately I fell in love.  Warm, clean enviroment that had lots to view.  I got lost in the front half of the store with all of the cool stuff that they had, with the cute magnets, funny tins for change, candles and knick knacks for sale.  I wandered to the back of the store where the books were and was happy with the selection that they had.  Organized like a traditional \big box\ bookstore, everything was easy to locate and appealing to the eye.I ended up going to the service counter in the back to see if they could locate the book that I wanted, and was helped by a nice guy who not only paid attention to what I was saying, but walked me to the area that my book should have been.  Unfortunately, they did not have it in stock, but I was told that it could be ordered if I was interested.Staff was great, store is clean and organized, and I was happy to see that they sold more then books.  Its also attached to a wildflower bakery if you would like to grab a bite to eat or drink.  I ended up grabbing a muffin and sat in the back reading my own book that I brought with me for the Yelpers book club at the end of the month.This place is worth going out of your way for, and I highly reccomend it.  Great independant location.",4nDPPNMu,4846
1899,4,Having lunch with a girlfriend,ZC749nuG,357
1900,3.4,"With a worried, \Hmmm....\ my eyes flicked from Yelp App showing one, four star review for Mr. Leno, up to the the front doors of Mr. Leno from within my rental car, then back down again.I was in the middle of another instance of late night hunger meets little confidence in search results. Mr. Leno, from the outside, looks as corporate as Rubio's Fish Tacos. As Qdoba. I was ready for the most burned out tortilla with the nastiest sour cream and blandest meat imaginable. But... Mexican sounded better than Burger King and at nearly midnight, nothing else in the area is open.I took my chances and I'm glad I did.While the exterior definitely looks like you're about to chow on some mediocre nonsense, the food Mr. Leno served up was on point.I switched my order to rolled tacos after seeing the option on the menu. They were incredible. Cheesy, guacamole-y, beef (though chicken is available). Even better was the hot sauce which is exactly the blend I love. It emulates my favorite taco shop in San Diego and to describe it would be... hot, hot, hot, but... with an onion-ish flavor. Incredible.That meal definitely hit the spot after falling asleep right after returning from work to the hotel and waking up six hours later starving; lunch having been 13 hours earlier.",WtTqAAQd,3991
1901,1.9,I hadn't been to Applebee's in years,gypcfy1D,2848
1902,2.4,"This is my second time in Chandler for work, and I've been here about four times.  I've basically come here every day during my visits.  It's a great place to have a casual meal and get some more work done.  I like the food and the friendly service, and also refuse to pay for the wireless in my hotel room (even though my employer would reimburse me for it).  Plus, I like the relaxed, community-esque feel of this place.As for the food, I'd recommend the Tuscan Chicken sandwich - the Ciabatta bread it comes on is really quite delicious, but make sure it's fresh.  salads are simple, but pretty good, and everything tastes fresh.  The chocolate chip cookies are to-die-for.  The people who work here are very friendly.  One guy was particularly helpful and helped me as I contemplated for about five minutes what I should get.  He then came to check how my food was, even though this is a self-service type of place.  I would not recommend the half-sandwich half-salad combo if you're really hungry.  Somehow a whole sandwich seemed more filling to me.Even though I avoid chain restaurants, I really like this one!  Maybe it's because we don't have one in Northern California, so it still makes me feel like this is \something different\.",nrfooiQt,1333
1903,2.6,I like IKEA for many reasons. I won't list them because fellow Yelper's have already done so. I must warn you though,mohP4SmM,3385
1904,2.6,The Wig Wam Resort is a sprawling complex west of Phoenix in Litchfield Park. It has old school charm,UTe09Pcz,3253
