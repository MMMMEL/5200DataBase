I also lived in Italy when I was in the Navy and was blessed to enjoy the heavenly wood fired stone oven pies that was as good as it gets.\n\nThroughout my travels, Grimaldi's is the closest thing to the great pizzas of Italy.  Cooked over charcoal briquets, the pizzas come out perfectly -- thin crusts that are tender and soft yet rigid enough where it won't collapse.  The crust is bursting with flavor.  Cheese and toppings were equal to the outstanding crust. \n\nI had my Grimaldi's plain and I had it once with anchovies.  I loved both. But as I learned in Italy: The best pizzas, the ones the old \paisons\"" liked were the simple cheese pizzas with no toppings [The old men of Italy would probably laugh at some American dude eating a sloppy 12-topping \""Supreme Pizza.\"" That's not pizza, that's garbage on dough!!!]. I'd say the plain cheese pizza is the best pizza to get at Grimaldi's.\n\nSalads, beverages and service are all top notch.  Servers are friendly and attractive.\n\nYou can't go wrong with the many great restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale.  But Grimaldi's is probably my favorite.""",J2ec91eK,1689

Our guilty pleasure is ordering on Tuesday nights when it's buy one, get the second for $5 (or is it half-price?  some kind of great deal)....and eating pizza while we watch Biggest Loser.  I'm always a fan of pepperoni, and their crust is crispy thin...the best way.  Also like the Casablanca...artichoke hearts, mushrooms, ricotta, parmesan, mozzarella...so tasty.  Great to have Gluten-free crust as an option, and the ingredients are fresh.  Yes, it's a small west coast chain...but they do it \right\"".   Friendly staff, speedy service, easy location.""",EJHcXVBa,1590

5,2018-05-16 00:34:54,"Made an 8:15 reservation on Yelp for a late Vday dinner with the Mrs. last Friday. Wanted to check out Cowboy Cio, but then saw the reviews about CPH and decided to give it a try. \n\nGot there at 8pm and was greeted with a smile. Our table was still at 8:15, but the hostess said we could hang at the bar or the stinky patio. Had quick service for a glass of Pinot and Tanqueray and tonic ($20 without tip). OK pour. \n\nShort wait and we were whisked away to a table for 2. Was greeted by Clark who quickly got us more drinks and asked if we had any questions. Good guy, very helpful and honest about his choices. We switched gears to a Lagunitas IPA ($5) and sangria ($8), which was served nicely. \n\nRead about the Pork bellly Pastrami app and the Citizen Chop Salad, so we ordered both. Clark hooked it up so we could have each in courses per say. Pork belly was awesome! C'mon - rye spaetzle, Brussels sprout sauerkraut = goodness. Citizen Chopped - chayote, snow pea greens, grape tomato, heirloom popcorn, grilled halloumi cheese, cucumber-onion salad & parsley-garlic dressing! Very unique tastes and refreshing. Would like to have that salad in the summer for sure!\n\nMain courses - The Mrs. had the Short Ribs ($28) and I ordered the Meatloaf... yeah, I know... I was hoping for something epic in meatloaf, but it was good. Nuthin special. The Short ribs on the other hand were EPIC! It is served with this dried cherry bbq sauce that you would not hesitate to lick the small bowl dry! The short rib had a dark right out the BBQ pit look. It was AWESOME! Comes with roasted parsnip puree & seasonal veg. \n\nDessert - \DONUTS & COFFEE\"" ($10) - Bourbon glazed donut bread pudding, vanilla sauce, cafe au lait ice cream, brown sugar streusel... + More AWESOME! If you go, get it! \n\nOverall, A good experience. I want to give it 3.5 stars. Service was prompt, Food was good, but it was the surprises in the ingredients that made it fun. Good mix of people too. The price is a little high by a few bucks for items in my opinion. I mean a $20 meatloaf should have been effin epic - Right?!""",sSnWW7wX,2532

13,2018-02-27 19:10:43,"Why did it feel like I was the only person that has NOT eaten at Benihana?  Probably because I was.  Anyway, I am a huge fan of teppanyaki and have been to several other places around the valley who do it quite well.  I mean how can you not love flaming onion volcanoes, shrimp acrobatics and other food awesomeness?  It's like a circ du solei of food!  Yet I didn't listen to almost everyone I know or 2/3rds of the Yelp reviews saying this place isn't all that wonderful.  Ok, ok - one point Yelp and my friends; zero points Jason.  Benihana isn't in fact all that great.\n\nBenihana is however good at making a teppanyaki place that runs like a well oiled machine or at least a ride at Disney Land.  They shuffle you in, wait until your table is full, put on a little show, charge you way too much then shuffle you out the door to make room for the next group.\n\nAside from the food being waaaaay overpriced, the service is excellent and meals tasty.  The \show\"" isn't bad either.  Except now they aren't allowed to do any of the cool stuff because people were apparently getting hurt from flying shrimp and flaming onion volcanoes.  And Benihana being a corporate chain behemoth decided they better do away with the \""dangerous\"" stuff.  Bummer!\n\nIn my option the food and service is on par with just about any other teppanyaki place around.  So, if you have a hankering for the stuff you are probably better off going to Ichi Bahn or some other place that may be cheaper, not feel like a Disney ride, and do cooler food tricks n' stuff.  But, if you must go, sign up for Benihana's birthday club thing because they will give you a $30 gift certificate which is pretty solid and the reason why I went.""",SJMk4ytu,4502

24,2018-04-21 05:48:43,"The moment I walked in, I saw one table seated and not a soul at the hostess desk. I waited about 3 minutes and got seated to my tacky red picnic tablecloth covered booth. Then the waitress came out of her hiding shell and decided to take my order. I ordered the individual pepperoni pizza. Me, being the asshole that I am, took my phone out and counted how long my order would take to get to me. It took twelve minutes on the dot. Could've been faster, I thought to my self. Then I looked at it...I mean, you see it don't you? A beautiful burnt on one side and slightly under cooked on the other...now that's amore. Oh and don't forget the garnish of a wilted and sad basil leaf. Then I took a bite. It tasted kind of familiar...hmm...what flavors went on in my mouth that my memory had been triggered...I got it, DOMINO's. I could clearly see the bumps on the bottom of the pizza which only mean one thing. This was cooked on a conveyor belt. In New York City, the best pizzas that I've had there came out of a hot stone/brick oven. If they have all those pictures up of New York City wouldn't it make sense to cook it the way New Yorkers have been doing it for decades? The soggy and flappy dough was spongy and I didn't enjoy it. So the waitress asks me \How was your pizza sir?\"" I responded \""slightly burnt, thank you for asking.\"" Then she brings up the fact that she knew that it was burnt and still served it to me. Wow. As disappointing as that experience was, it wasn't all awful. There was dessert. I ordered cheesecake. Why? Because I fucking love cheesecakeIt came out and it was actually pretty good. The Graham cracker crust was pretty tasty and it was slightly dense but very creamy. The strawberry sauce, kind of tasted like melted high fructose smuckers sauce. If you can't tell from reading this, I'm obviously never going back to this place ever again. EVER. Shitty pizzerias like this place need to die.""",EyTwUh8B,4913

It's actually better than the eggplant at Tottie's and I'm a huge Tottie's fan!  The portions are really big, and I've found everything to have a ton of flavor.  I especially like that when you get take out, you get side containers of hot sauce to spice everything up as much as your little heart desires.\n\nAnn, the owner, is extremely sweet - I spoke to her for awhile during my last visit when I did take-out.  She told me they've got a website coming soon, and I noticed that on the menu she gave me, it says \""we deliver\"" on it... I'll have to try that sometime.  Another bonus? They are open on Sundays!\n\nI think I may have been Thai in a past life... I love Thai food and could eat it every day if given the chance.  While the restaurant itself lacks character, it's clean, and I found the service to be attentive.

27,2018-03-08 11:22:22,"We ordered a couple pizzas tonight via their on-line system and were given an estimated delivery time of about 25 minutes.  We thought this sounded quite short but were willing to give them a little leeway.  After they missed the estimated delivery time by 45 minutes I called to see what the status of our pizza was.  Alexa or Alexis (not sure which) answered the phone and as soon as she pulled up our order she started apologizing profusely, she put me on hold and after a few minutes another person answered the phone with much more of a gruff voice, didn't say anything except \this is ???? (didn't catch name).  I figured the phone had been picked up by someone else so I told her I was talking to the other person.  She told me she was the manager and that the driver said he tried to deliver the pizza and the woman that answered the door told him they already got their pizza?!?!\n\nSince it's my wife and I that were home, both expecting the pizza and both irritated that it hadn't arrived there is no way that happened at this house.  I couldn't tell if the driver messed up terribly or if this was their cover story for messing up our order and not getting it out.\n\nGranted...they did offer to recook the pizzas and deliver them for free but at this point they are done in my book.  The last thing I want is a pizza cooked and delivered by disgruntled people.  This is the last time we will ever attempt to get a pizza from them and highly recommend you use caution when ordering.""",6jRT0VV9,3536

Was seated right in front of the kitchen and got a birds eye view of the goodies as they were being made.  Had the fried green tomatoes which were delicious.  Chickpeas were not really my thing, fried but a bit dry.  Jidori Chicken with polenta croutons was addictive.  The sauce, the buttery and fried polenta cubes.  I had to remember that I was in public and it was inappropriate to lick the plate clean.  The fingerling potatoes which are called \fat, fat potatoes\"" are delicious but nothing that I couldn't make at home.  The leeks are indeed delicious.  The menu is great for sharing, and in fact I think sharing is the way to go.  The restaurant was kind enough to send out a potato soup that was dressed with truffle oil and shaved black truffles.

56,2018-03-07 03:16:02,"I.Love.This.Place.\n\nAdjacent to Changing Hands Bookstore, this small local change is fantastic, a great accompaniment to CHB and a great location (Guadalupe and McClintock) for a break from errands (or in my case, riding my bike-right around here is usually when I need to take a rest and eat something fast). Really warm and inviting, it reminds me of a classier Au Bon Pain (you Boston-ites will know what I'm spittin' here). A fast food restaurant that is tastier, cheaper, and friendlier than most \sit down restaurants\"". \n\nThe set up (going from the entrance from CHB, not the door) is first off a sampling of their bread of the day with either butter or olive oil to dip in. You have the line with bagels right behind the cashiers, and a small bakery case to look at such good offerings as Chocolate Pumpkin muffins and their scones and cake slices. It can be a mad house here at lunch time, many people opting to take it to go-their sandwiches go on average 6-8 dollars-but they are huge, fresh and top notch-totally worth the price. Unfortunately, there isn't a whole lot of meat free or dairy free options for me for lunch right now (they have seasonal menus) but for all you carnivores-DAMN. Good soups too (I would avoid the weird, mushy tomato bread stuffing on the side and replace with chips-maybe you'll like it but I doubt it). They also have huge salads and pasta entrees for dinner times.\n\nTheir breakfast and coffee is where they shine. The coffee is available at the self serve and they have a huge container of SOY MILK (yes!!!!!!) at your disposal. They can make tons of drinks and have tea as well, so if you're into that, prices seem market. But you have to try b-fest once here. Serve till 10am on weekdays, 2pm on weekends, they have stuffed french toast fruit, frittatas, I mean, it is soooooo delicious. AND FAST. If you can snag a table. Essentially you should try to have someone grab a table and tell you what they want since turnover is fast, but there are a LOT of people waiting to snag your seat (so don't linger either-its just kinda rude). The drill is you order the food, they give you a special flag for the table (if to go, you just wait near the kitchen and coffee kiosk), your coffee cup, you grab the coffee and grab a table and they bring it to you when ready. Pretty nice! Oh, and the staff is relentlessy friendly and efficient-I really don't know how they do it.\n\nThey do have seating outside that is pretty nice and a \""trust\"" option for their baguettes where you drop money off and grab a fresh one near the door so you don't have to deal with the line. So grabbing some bread for the week or dinner that night is a fantastic option as well.""",LbyLRUGS,1594

The food was tasty, but once again the service sucks.

Strangely, the waitress that arrived to ask us what we would like to drink couldn't/wouldn't take our food order, as someone else was actually our waiter.  Huh?  Well, we finally were able to order from our real waiter (who was very nice, by the way and the ONLY reason for 2 stars vs 1) and our World Famous Gyros arrived shortly.  \n\nUh, no.

66,2018-04-08 10:38:06,"Moved into San Antigua apartment about six months ago. Right when we moved in there was issues with apartment  they didnt properly clean the apt there was hair clogging the bathtub drain and dog hair all over the carpet still. I asked maintenance people to come over THREE times because are dishwasher doesn't work and all they do is put CLR in it. I was just in the office the other day and someone was complaining about the same issue about the dishwasher.  You have to put in a maintenance call in and that took up to three weeks. Then I realize almost all the grills don't work and the tv was broken in the gym for months. Also, they were redoing the pool for about 4 months during spring time when people actually want to use the pool. They couldnt do it during winter time.  \nThey are too busy just making the outside look nice so people will rent from them. BUT after all that on a November  morning made me never.. NEVER rent from these people again. On a Monday morning I walked out my apartment to go to work a new job I just got and it's really important for me to get there on time. Well to my surprise my car was missing. I thought someone stole it and called the police immediately. I found out San Antigua had a tow company come in and just tow cars if they are park wrong at all. My car was barely on the white line like really big deal it didn't hurt anyone people could still park. So on my Monday morning I had to find this towing place which was 40 mins in the opposite direction I go to work during rush hour to get my car and pay 100 bucks. I went back to the apt complex went straight to the manager and ask How can you do this to your tenants? Oh wait I couldn't even talk to the manager she was hiding behind the door to her office and made the front girl say she was in a meeting she wasn't. She just didn't want to deal with angry tenants when I scream she finally came out and kick me out. They said there been plenty of people coming in here and upset. Well I wonder why. They said they have no control over it, which is bullshit because the towing company needs a code to even get in the complex because it's gated and they tow at night time when people are sleeping. Obviously they get money for it and the tow company is in bad area of Mesa.  There answer to everything well park better. They also kick me out of the clubhouse because I was upset. WHO WOULDN'T BE UPSET ON A MONDAY MORNING WHEN YOUR CAR MISSING BECAUSE OF APT COMPLEX THAT LETS A SHADY TOW COMPANY COME IN!! \n\nHorrific customer service skills there. They couldn't even give us a warning that they let a towing company in at night. They have no answers they instead, just kick their tenants out of the office when I confront them. The manager wouldn't even talk to me just kicked me out and the maintenance supervisor who should be busy fixing things and not standing around was rude saying things like \well maybe if you learned how to park right it wouldn't happen\"". They have no compassion or kindness for people who live there.\n\nThey don't even want to talk to you. They don't care about their tenants and how much stress they put on me. They just want money! On a side note my car was totaled from hail and I was getting rid of the car at end of the week so I have been very stressed with car issues. They are scammers and I wouldn't tell my worst enemy to move here. I can't wait until my lease is up so I can move out of here. It just really hurts me how people in this world can treat other people like this. I might lose my job today because of them! Thanks\nSan Antigua you're a real class act.""",DJO5TDI5,3048

I was completely unimpressed with the hostesses and the service (which was slow, rude, and totally unhelpful), the food was disappointing (not fresh, not tasty, not innovative), and the ambiance was definitely not what it was built up to be. We ordered a variety of entrees and sushi rolls, both of which were completely inauthentic Japanese and nothing special in terms of preparation or ingredients. I would have rather eaten at PF Changs or Roys, where I would be spared the pretentiousness. Also, the place is crowded. Not in a good, social lounge scene way. In a nasty, don't have enough room to eat/breathe way. For some reason word of mouth has gotten out that Zen 32 is THE sushi place, but spare yourself the tasteless reality.

The question is...will it ever achieve it ?? \n\n I applaud the \vision\"" of Karl Kopp, I feel he preserved the original architectural elements of the building, while finally catapulting the central Phoenix's bar /restaurant scene into 2008.  Finally an upscale restaurant and bar that actually looks like money went into the renovation... Ikea purchased items were not identified here.   \n\nThe main \""lobby\"" bar/restaurant on the first floor is huge... anchored by a large square bar in the center of the room... the ceiling soars above... a perfect space for an art installation.  The room is basically divided into a 60/40 bar/dining area with the main focus on the bar area.  \n\nSpeaking of the bar area... strange place... although the seating at the bar is exceptional, several standard bar features are missing... The standard visual liquor selection is nowhere to be found, and the bartender was at a loss for the choices of vodka.  I'm not sure where they bought their martini glasses... they are NOTHING close to the \""birdbath\"" martini  size of AZ88...perhaps someone confused the martini glass order and shipped out eye wash cups... I'm thinking that these are not the standard size  and it was all just a very evil joke! (Hint... if you enjoy olives in your martini... order them on the side.  Once  the spear of olives is removed from the drink,  the drink then becomes half empty... exzageration?  fabrication? Order one and decide for yourself)\n\nSpeaking of size..check out the enormous medieval torture device in the center of the bar... oh wait... I'm sorry... it's an industrial size prosciutto slicer.. Silly me.  Bevnaps where never used, perhaps they have not been stocked yet?? \n\nThe restaurant table service was spotty, if not aloof.  This type of attitude works great after the restaurant opens and introduces the red rope / bouncer.. my opinion... first learn how to wait on tables, then concentrate on affecting (or should I say...perfecting) the attitude.  \n\nThe \""deconstructed\"" prosciutto and melon plate we ordered was nothing special, the crisp bread pizza type app was ok.. again, nothing exciting here.  Well, that's not true.. as there IS something exciting in this bar... The bathroom area on the mezzanine level!!.. mirrors and white hot lighting ensures that if you look \""good\"" in that lighting... you'll look \""GREAT\"" in the soft lighting of the bar area.  \n\nThe balcony seating area in my opinion would be better used as a low seating area rather than a dining area. One can only hope that the upper floors will be used for live music and outdoor seating.  The basement should be opening soon, potentially a moshpit dance area? Who knows..  If you've been to Swigg in Santa Fe, you'll feel right at home here... Check it out, give it a try... or wait until they \""weed out\"" the bad help and get the place up to speed.""",USOyuH8s,654

We were craving Thai and had recently moved to Chandler, so we headed out to Thai Paradise with high hopes due to the high ratings.\n\n While the ambiance was definitely lacking, we don't let that affect our judgment of a restaurant. The waitress was courteous when we walked in. Our order was not yet ready, but she told us to have a seat and it would be just a moment. She asked if we wanted a drink, as well. I got a Thai iced tea which was good.\n\nShe carefully wrapped up our food and we were on our way home. We ordered the curry noodle with tofu, and the green curry with tofu. It smelled delicious. Upon opening the container I noted that the curry appeared to be watered down quite a bit. This was not something I had ever experienced at any other Thai restaurant. Unfortunately, it was watered down so much, it ended up being sub-par, and I was thoroughly disappointed. The curry noodle was alright, but nothing too great. I was left still hungry, and yet not wanting a second helping as I often do. Furthermore, people have mentioned the \huge\"" portions, however, I consider the portion size pretty normal. We get more when we order from Szechuan in Mesa.\n\nOverall, the food was OK. Would I go back? Perhaps. I would rather place an order at Szechuan which is 20 minutes from our house, and make the drive, or drive to Tempe and eat at Thai Basil. This is surely not the best Thai food in AZ.

However, kudos to whoever designed the business car and logo. It was appealing, distinctive, and colorful front and back.  The store needs to incorporate the color scheme on walls and furnishings.""",KB6zUBNc,2374

The salsa is very good if you like fresh tasting salsa that is very runny.  The guac isn't always very good but the meat and toppings go well with the dish.  The atmosphere is supper casual and the bar sits in the middle which isnt very large but this place gets super busy in the evening and there is alot of energy in the place.

118,2018-02-23 04:29:22,"This rating is based on first experience on a Saturday around 8:30 pm. We did not have a reservation. There were four of us in our party. They use the OpenTable system. If you're planning on a weekend night, I suggest you use it. This was a very busy night.\n\nWe're not taking into account the 50 minute wait for a table. That was completely our bad for not making reservations (it was a last minute thing) and our desire to sit outside (even longer wait) as it was very loud and crowded (this seems to be another regular occurrence with Fox restaurants: they don't architect enough sound dampening to handle their capacity and they encourage standing room only at the bar with very loud/upbeat music (there was a DJ). I believe this is within their control, but they merely wish it this way.\n\nFox Restaurant concepts has a knack for creating restaurants with a 'hip' atmosphere and a certain kind of clientele in mind. This was my first time here but my fifth Fox Restaurant visit. I'm starting to notice the ingredients/entrees are 'shared' across Fox menus. This can be a good thing as mainly these items are fresh and of high quality.\n\nWe ordered 3 rounds of drinks, appetizers, entrees, and desserts. We kept a lively mood as we were good friends who hadn't seen each other in a while. Three of us had previous restaurant experience.\n\nSam Fox stresses \outstanding hospitality every time\"". There are little things good and bad not worth noting. They're just what you'd expect on a busy Friday night at a popular place. That being said it would have been 'outstanding' if that kind of thing you expect everywhere else didn't apply here.\n\nOverall the food was very good (the sweet potato canneloni was noteworthy as well as mushroom soup du jour). However the service and pacing are what killed the experience for all of us.  \n\nWhen disappointment was expressed in an item he was not apologetic, in fact he was downright combative: \""Oh, I know I said there would be 10 meatballs, but these were the last ones for the night. (there were six small ones). There was no offer to replace them with something else.  \""It's a Sicilian tirimasu I TOLD you it would have citrus flavors (there were overriding orange flavors). Again, no offer to replace the item. Then of course the strange insistence he had on setting items directly in front of someone who was speaking, obscuring their view of others (a simple wait of 30 seconds would not have been disruptive), but the lack of urgency to clear the table end of meal when he was nowhere to be found and empty dessert plate sat until even after the bill was taken.\n\nHow can I write this in such detail? Because while we all tried to converse, catch up and ignore his faux pas it became harder and harder to do so until we burst out in nervous laughter. We ended up poking fun at his strange actions to keep things light. As I mentioned we'd all worked as servers so we just shrugged it off, gave him his 20% and chalked it up to a poor luck of the draw. We didn't complain to the manager or give him a hard time because he's just trying to make a living (and we didn't want the night to end on THAT note), we just all shook our heads and pondered if he knew why he probably wasn't do so well as a waiter.\n\nI know Fox concepts wants a guest to have a great time, come back and recommend their places, but it also takes friendly service. Hospitality as Sam Fox defines it.  Even if there were a bunch of mistakes, friendliness, humility and a desire to please would have gone a long way with this group. He would do well to have more training, better quality control (why would an item go out less than promised/) and to retain employees of greater dedication and character.\n\nWe'll probably come back, but if we see this guy again, we'll definitely request someone else.""",XC4OZtmW,2267

126,2018-03-03 03:18:35,"When I called to schedule my appointment it took several weeks to get in because the hours that they offered for the Botox treatments were limited.  I asked at the time if I could have numbing cream before my Botox injections because I REALLY don't like needles.  They said \yes, for a fee of $20\"".  It was free with my Botox at a medi spa that I have been to in the past, but overall, I was just glad that they had it so that I could be more comfortable during my treatment. They asked me to come in 30 minutes prior to my appointment so that I could put the cream on and wait for it to take effect.  \n\nI called the day of my appointment to confirm the time to come in early for the numbing cream (no one had called me to confirm my appointment) and they confirmed my time and that 30 minutes early for the cream would be good. So when I arrived the person at the desk said. \""Let me make sure we have some of the cream\"".  I started to panic!  Wouldn't this be something they would check in advance of my arrival?  What if they didn't have it?  Would I have to tough it out, or wait another 6 weeks to reschedule?  Luckily, they had the cream. She allowed me to pay for it and then told me to take a seat in the lobby.  I sat and waited for awhile but it was now nearly 15 minutes into my scheduled time to start the cream.  I went back up to the desk and asked if I shouldn't be waiting in a room with the cream on my face instead if wasting time in the lobby and she agreed and put me in a room right away with the cream.\n\nI sat for 20 minutes with the cream on before the nurse arrived. She came in and nonchalantly told me that she couldn't administer Botox to someone with numbing cream on because I wouldn't be able to move my muscles for her to know where to inject me.  She said it was outside the standard of practice to use numbing cream for Botox.  I told her that I had had it before and the Botox turned out great and she was defensive and would not listen to me.  She insisted on \""winning\"" and told me that she had been administering Botox for 9 years and had never heard of anyone using it.  I told her that I had paid for the cream and would prefer to leave it on for the full 30 minutes and she promptly wiped it off of my forehead before I realized what she was doing.  Why would they offer the cream to me for $20 if it was outside the standard of practice for the Botox injections?  The nurse was aggressive, defensive, and very rude.  If she really couldn't administer Botox with the use of numbing cream, then why did she do it anyway?  I was able to make all the muscle movements that she requested of me with no problem.  The numbing cream just numbs the surface of the skin, not the muscles!  It probably doesn't even help that much but it's piece of mind for this needle phob!\n\nAfter the procedure she left the room and told me she was going to find my chart.  I didn't know if I needed to sign something, or why she was telling me she needed my chart right then so I waited for her to return.  She did not give any aftercare instructions, ask me if I had any questions, say \""goodbye\"" or \""thank you\"", or do anything to lead me to believe that we were finished.  I thought she was coming right back.  I sat in the room for 10 more minutes wondering if she was planning to return.  Finally I went out to look for her and no one was at the front desk.  I walked up to another nurse who seemed very friendly and asked her if she knew if the other nurse was returning.  By then the front desk person had returned and she said, \""Oh, the nurse said she thought you were sitting around waiting for the numbing cream to wear off\"".  REALLY?  Why not check on me, or let me know that we are finished?  She was unbelievably rude!\n\nUnfortunately my experience at AZ Laser was very unpleasant and I would never return nor recommend it to anyone else.""",J4zdVMvP,1951

128,2018-04-16 14:48:58,"I believe I have found it.

I ordered the spring rolls and the bun bo hue. I decided to use the restroom and when I came back the rolls were already on the table. I was just about done with the roll order when they came out with the bowl of noodle soup. I then wanted to order something to go so I figured I would do so before I was done with lunch so I ordered it while I was about done with my noodles. Before I knew it and before I was done eating, they came out with my take out order! They are damn fast. \n\nThe dining area had plenty of space and there was a good mixture of people eating while I was there. I would say the cleanliness was a bit better than your typical small business Asian restaurant.  \n\nArea: I'm not originally from AZ so I can tell you nothing for sure about the neighborhood, but using my \street smarts\"", I can tell you that the area appears less nice than if you kept going east on Camelback (towards Scottsdale), but who cares. If you're serious about your foods, you should brave certain danger to get good eats.   \n\nIf you're an ABC or ABV longing for the tastes of your ethnic origins or simply an \""adventurous eater\"" you must give Pho Thanh a try. You'll definitely find here what they lack on menus in other AZ pho/Vietnamese locations.\n\nEDIT: I just thought it pertinent to say that \""bun bo hue\"" or spicy beef noodle soup is by far my favorite item there. Even on the east coast, there are few pho places that offer a similar dish. I have really found a treasure in Pho Thanh that makes my AZ living a bit better.""",0ywqPkNY,2517

We sat outside on the patio and my group of 4 only ordered 'Happy Hour' items off both the food and martini menu, but we ordered alot. The martinis at Blue Wasabi are top notch, I ordered a Lemon Drop martini, the Mowie Wowie, and the \Milky Way\"" which tastes just like the candy bar and comes in a caramel dipped martini glass. Yum! The great thing about Blue Wasabi is they have more than just sushi on the menu, so if you're not in the mood for seafood, there are other items to try. For instance my companions ordered the Macadamia Chicken Strips which came with a sweet n sour sauce, and we ordered the 'Fowl Play\"" which had Grilled and chilled chicken and wrapped like sushi. Both items were perfect to taste. We also ordered many seafood items such as the 'MARILYN MONROLL' one of our favorites and we love the presentation of it but our new favorite by far is the 'WANGO MANGO ROLL\"" it tastes so different but is AMAZING! You must try it. We are still trying to figure out if the Blue Wasabi is made blue with food coloring or if it is actually a different kind of wasabi. It tastes a lil lighter than the traditional green wasabi. Our waiter Chris is one of the best waiters in Phoenix, he remembered us from last time and gave us top notch service, he is attentive without being intrusive. We were there for HOURS last night and some in our party got a lil tipsy off all the martini's but we had a great time without breaking the bank cause we left right after Happy Hour ended. ;-)""",pHHoCSmj,2631

The pho is obviously the star, and this version lives up to expectations. Nicely-scented broth and a wide variety of beef cuts to choose from (I'll stick with the round eye, but my boyfriend loves the \weird\"" cuts like tripe and tendon). I also really love the Ca ri (curry coconut milk chicken) with noodles or bread, and another dish under specials which is like a beef stew crossed with pho. The fresh rolls are also delicious, as is the Vietnamese coffee (iced).\n\nThere is probably nothing really unique about this place in terms of the food--it is good Vietnamese. The reason I'm giving this place 5 stars is the great service, huge portions (aka great value), and the knowledge that anything I order will be good.

I knew the food would be hot, I read the other reviews. But, does it really need to be that hot. Kind of seems like they are trying to cover something up.\n\nThe service was good it's just the ala carte menu, all of the \NO\"" signs you see throughout the restaurant and the menu.

150,2018-02-23 04:42:39,I have dined at Picazzo's several times around the valley since it is one of the places my son can enjoy pizza (gluten free). I have always had an enjoyable experience as we both had this evening. My only complaint for this particular location is that the wairtstaff seemed incompotent. For a dinning room with 7 occupied tables there were 3 waiters yet somehow the guests were still neglected? We ordered the medium ultimate pepperoni and my 3 year old consumed 4 of the 6 pieces as I was able to eat 2,ME2K6plC,872

Although it tasted good, I was not happy with it because of the vegetables.  Very few chinese vegetables in it.  They put in those tiny round green sweet peas instead of snap peas.  There were green pepper and carrots and celery.  I asked the owner on the way out, why didn't I get the cinese vegetables?  He told me that I have to request them.  Excuse me, isn't this a Chinese restaurant?  All he said was, \Sorry about that.\""  I would think that he would be concerned about keeping customers happy.  Every time I went there for lunch,the place only had two or three people there.  One more thing.  The food is served really fast.  It makes me wonder if they just heat it up real fast instead of cooking it when it's ordered.  I do not recomend this restaurant.  I won't be back.  It's also over priced.""",vFVcav5E,177

We were bummed when they stopped serving dinner a few years ago but understood because we were usually the only people in the restaurant for dinner. They still serve breakfast and lunch though.

159,2018-01-18 02:01:23,"As a Phoenician I sometimes forget that we're lucky to have nature trails in the midst of the urban sprawl of this desert city. We may not have a memorable downtown skyline but something Phoenix does have a lot of are mountains that serve as a backdrop of gorgeous scenery. We are blessed to have many mountains with trails in each \park\"" like North Mountain, the Mcdowell's, the Estrella's, Camelback, and the Grand Dame of Phoenix, South Mountain. This range or urban park which is considered the world's largest serves as a visual landmark to many. During the day, coming from downtown and head down Central Ave, South Mountain towers majestically over this metropolis and at night, the glimmering red lights of the tv/radio towers that sit at its summit just sparkle. It provides direction, and this natural backdrop can also lay claim to being a memorable Phoenix landmark. But apart from its visual beauty this urban park provides an active recreation outlet to residents of metro Phoenix for it has many different trailheads at various points from Ahwatukee to Laveen. I liken South Mountain to be like Runyon Canyon in Hollywood, but here we have far more trails and it ranges from the easy to the difficult. And like Runyon Canyon you can drive up South Mountain and look below and see the grand expanse of sprawl glowing under the night sky and just take it all in. Yes, we are lucky to have this, literally in our backyard.""",n6gxC4SF,4915

I originally came here to buy that super cool Ciate Caviar nail polish ($25) for my friend for her birthday. Well, then I saw the Too Faced section and thought, \hmm, I haven't been here in awhile so let's go see what they have\"" (side note: yes, that was a stupid idea, but I'm female and have shopping issues). Well, since its getting hot as balls outside, I wanted to look for a face primer that would help hydrate my skin and also keep my foundation on when I do decide to wear it in the summer months. Great, found one that feels silky smooth on the back of my hand, done ($30). Oh look, what's that *reaches for the Coconut Oil Body Bronzer* ($35). \""Doesn't that smell delicious\"" says one of the employees \""it smells like I'm in heaven drinking a pi\u00f1a colada\"" I reply. The super cute employee then proceeds to put a dab a bit on my arm and make it look all shimmery and bronzy. My subconscious then tells me to snap out of it and I reply, \""thanks for the sample, I'll have to think about it\"". She states \""no problem, but here, let me show you the other popular bronzer by NARS \"" and she proceeds to walk me over to another fab makeup brand and apply their bronzer ($45) on my other arm and it makes me look all summery and pretty (but the Too Faced smelled way better). I reluctantly say \""thanks for giving me options, I'll have to think about which one I want and come back later\"" and start making my way to the check out counter with my two items, even though I really wanted that Too Faced bronzer.\n\nSo there I am, waiting to check out with two customers in front of me abut then all of a sudden, I ended up in their perfume section being helped by another friendly and helpful employee. I tell her I wasn't sure if it was the fact that I had be drinking a lot or that the perfume a girl was wearing at the bar smelled really good and I wanted to see if they had it, it's by a Victor and Rolph. \""Flowerbomb\"" she replies and then proceeds to spray sample of one of those paper things and also gives me a history on this perfume (it's been around for eight years). I instantly fall in love and tell her that I would love to get some, but I don't need a lot cause I don't wear perfume that much (maybe once every two weeks). She goes through all the different sizes, sprays, dab-ons, and roller ball types, and I end up getting the smallest spray size ($50). I then finally ignore the rest of the store and check out...\n\nThis store has everything! Makeup, skincare, fragrance, bath/body, tools/accessories, nail polish, and even a men's section. Brands include: the Art of Shaving, Bare Escentuals, BCBG, Betsey Johnson, Bobbi Brown, Burberry, oh gosh, I'm only on the 'b's, they have almost every brand you could imagine here and the customer service is always great!\n\nRecap: I would give this place 5 stars, but the fact that three items, that could all fit in one hand, total $114, leaves me not being able to afford the extra star; I really want that Too Faced Coconut Oil Bronzer; and I blame the two customers in front of me for ultimately making me get the perfume ;)""",M1iKzrsz,3472

Once the hostess finally acknowledged us and came to seat us she informed us that they were closing in 30 minutes and we needed to order right away. This was at 8:20pm on a Saturday night! She turned away another party later at 8:50pm by saying the kitchen was closed for the evening. As of writing this the website still says they are open til 10pm.

I can jam out of the office, grab lunch for the crew and myself, and be back in 15 minutes.  A win in my book.\n\nAs for the tasty morsels they've got to offer, I really haven't had anything bad.  From the meat and spinach pies (a syrian and lebanese delicacy), to the perfectly toasted turkey melt, I tend to leave this place a happy camper on a regular basis.  Everything off the menu is prepared to order (and comes out quick I might add), and they also offer a daily special called the \lunch box\"".\n\nWhile the Turkey Melt is a close second, the lunch box is the main reason I continue to come back to Munch a Lunch.

Especially when it only costs $4.

191,2018-01-01 22:45:50,"It's hard to write a review for a restaurant that is loved by so many others as an Elite Yelper, and have to give it a \Meh\"" review. Cibo initially won me over with its great atmosphere, fantastic hosts and delicious appetizers, but it did not last. Be prepared for a lengthy review because I'd really like to describe my experience in full.\n\nI wound up at Cibo with a decent-sized group (12 total, I believe), and everything started off great; the drinks began flowing and the appetizer was being passed around for all to share. The process for ordering was a little slow, but busy Friday night, large table...no biggie. I completely understood, and we kept ourselves busy with conversation. After a bit we got our entr\u00e9e orders in and everyone went with pizzas, and not 10 minutes later, they began to arrive.\n\nNow, being the first visit for me, I decided to ask for recommendations. That's just what I like to do because I like to hear a server get really excited about one of their favorite dishes. For the white pizzas, our server suggested the Di Notte. I was instantly sold, so much so that I asked for a suggestion on the red pizzas. He then mentioned the Capricciosa, and after a brief chat between him, my girlfriend and myself (Important Note: about the artichokes on the pizza), I told him that we'd take it.\n\nGoing back to the arrival of the pizzas...they came out staggered, which made sense since there is only one pizza oven. We all began sharing as each pie came out, and life was good. First we got our Di Notte (a delicious mix of cheese and spicy salami) which was cooked perfectly and tasted great! A little later, after other pie orders began filling the table, came a vegetarian. The runners are slammed, and they just call out the names of the pizzas and wait for a hand to be raised. Not really hearing the name correctly, I asked if that was the pizza with the artichokes. The runner said yes, and I took the pizza (Note: I was the only one at the table that had artichokes on my pizza). This all brings me to the most awkward moment at a restaurant for me in a very long time. \n\nWe decided to wait on touching the vegetarian pizza because we thought the runner just delivered to the wrong table. It happens, and I was totally ready to hand that pie over unscathed. But when our server came back and I mentioned the potential mistake, he told me that was what I ordered and continued to repeat it over and over. This was an embarrassing situation mostly because I took HIS recommendation because it was my first visit, and we had never even mentioned the \""Vegetariana,\"" and because during the conversation we were having the whole table fell silent (funny little extra - the musician just started his break as well...complete silence). He caused a scene even after I had told him it was alright and we'd just take the pizza because it was a mistake. I tried not to place any blame and talked to him with a \""this happens\"" kind of demeanor, but he insisted that that's what we ordered...PLUS he said that he specifically remembered us ordering that because we weren't interested in artichokes. Guess what's on the Vegetariana, folks? Yep. Artichokes. A whole fourth of the pizza was covered in them (I love artichokes, by the way. This posed no problem.). Once that was pointed out, instead of any sort of apology, he decided to explain how the artichokes were only on one \""quadrant\"" of the pizza. C'mon now...I can see a bullshitter, and that was just blatant. It's ridiculous to claim that we ordered a different pizza because of one particular ingredient only to order another with the SAME ingredient. I hope you, the reader, is understanding the uncomfortable situation that I was in because it was a weird one. I kind of couldn't wait to get out of there for the remainder of the dinner.\n\nThat all being said, the woman at the cash bar, Melissa, was great, and she really made an effort to make our table feel a little more comfortable after the whole incident. I hope the owner of Cibo can take note of that because it wasn't really her job, but she was sweet, personable and took it upon herself to feel embarrassed and responsible for our server.\n\nMy first trip to Cibo was a bust, and it's really hard to want to make a return visit, but in time I'm sure I will.

Little did I know it would become my favorite burger ever! I'm referring to the Switch house burger. Ordered medium rare it come out a perfect pink inside and super juicy. Only once has it not come out as ordered and they were happy to take care of it for me. I have had other dishes there that were very good. They have food and drink specials every day.

It's on the way home and I was craving Chicken Fried Rice with a side of extra green onion. Duck juice too please, but they don't do that here.\n\nHere's a break down of my stars:\n\n1 Star: \nQuick Service. While at the counter I had Yelp up on my phone and I think the lady saw it because I placed my order she gave the order to the kitchen and started speaking in Chinese. It sounded like, \hurry up with order, this new customer and he on Yelp!\""\n\nMy order came out ahead of 2 orders previously placed by customers ahead of me. Hmm. Ok, impressive.\n\n2 Star: \nTons of Rice. The small box was stuffed with rice and generous amount of chicken. I had it for dinner and brunch the next day.\n\n3 Star: \nFriendly face with a smile for service and rightly priced. The side of onion was only 50cents extra with my total being about $5. The place was also clean on the inside.""",TJgLEusx,1677

The flatbread tandoori was pretty good, and would recommend the carne on a potato pancake.\n\nThe second time was on a dinner date- last Saturday.   WAY too loud- full of guys yelling at football games on the TVs  & their girlfriends trying to act interested.   Not just in the bar area, either- at random tables through the dining area.

For in room internet you had to have a laptop and it was $10 per day.  When we woke up on the third morning our room reaked heavily of cigarette smoke and was coming in through the AC.  We were in a non-smoking room.  Our clothes started to reak and I got a headache.  The front dest staff claimed they would \refresh\"" our room.  We didn't buy that so we requested to change rooms. That was no problem. They said they'd move our bags for us when we left at 9:30 AM. When we returned around 6 our bags were still in the old room.  In the new room the Coffee Machine was broken.  They said they fixed it but we tried it again the next morning and it didn't work.  Some of the lights were also burned out.  Unless you have a few specific rooms the view isn't that great.

My husband had the Denver omelette, he said it was pretty good not great, but not bad.  My mom enjoyed the Blueberry waffles, and she said they were amazing!  I liked that they had fresh blueberries on top, not just blueberry pie filling like you find at some places.\n\nPrices are not cheap, but in my opinion very reasonable.  My only real complaint is the service was terrible.  We were in slightly before the rush, by the time we left there was a wait but none when we came in.  I was disappointed that our server couldn't keep drinks filled.  The topper was when she dumped creamer on our table and just brought extra napkins.

My husband and my date nights are cursed, usually ending in violent bowel issues, vomiting, car accidents - you name it, we've probably experienced it, all in the name of a romantic evening. Monsoon season hits, and there goes the electricity/AC at Latitude Eight, the Thai wonderland we live down the street from and have been wanting to try for over two years. This is of course the fault of Mother Nature and not the restaurant. The staff was extremely gracious and kind, calling us \troopers\"" for saying to eat.

They really do not do brunch well.\n\nFirst off, when someone asks for egg whites, \we have tofu\"" is not an answer. If you are using eggs, egg whites are part of them. If you claim to not have them, it makes me wonder if you are using some sort of egg premix that cannot be separated.\n\nFurthermore, there is no sausage or bacon on the menu.

That is one star. \nWhile having just stopped in at the Ranch Market to pick up a few groceries, I was going to eat at the Market itself but decided to maybe try a place I had never tried near by instead. As I took my groceries to the car, I decided that since I had not yet tried \Tradiciones\"" I would give them a try. \nI enjoy the food at the Ranch Market-- tasty and authentic.  Since they are connected I THOUGHT the food would be the same. Boy was I wrong!  I don't know who they have cooking here, but with all the great stuff they have next door it should be A LOT better. \nThe salsa should have been the first clue...it was just ok.  Again, knowing what they make in house next door, made this salsa pretty sad.  Wanting an Agua Fresca to drink and again knowing next door had like 7+ varieties, I was disappointed they only had horchata and pina here. I got the pina, which was probably the best part of this meal. \nI was really craving some tacos, and noticed they only really offered them under the appetizer menu as street tacos. Also wanting to have a sopito, I thought WTH I will get the sampler platter and add a taco. \n\nThe platter came with 2 mini chimis, 2 mini taquitos, 2 mini cheese enchiladas and a soptio each of chicken and beef. All looked good when it came out. I enjoyed the taco first...the last thing I was to enjoy on this culinary outing. Then, digging into the chicken enchiladas, the sauce was a \""mole\"". This was not a good mole...way too sweet, someones idea of a mole. Yes, just because a mole has chocolate doesn't mean it's a chocolate sauce.  And the chicken, stringy bland kinda tough. Everything followed suit, bland not very authentic, someones idea of mexican food. It all reminded me of something I would get if in the Mid-west somewhere and wanted Mexican food...not Arizona! \n\nThe only saving grace to this meal was that it was happy hour on a Saturday and the platter was 1/2 off and the taco was a buck so I left paying only $9 instead of $15. \n\nWhile I will continue to eat at the Market....I will pass on TRADICIONES...*blegh*.""",5jNekQYl,4395

The resort itself must be very beautiful when it is not undergoing a lot of construction. The website photos look stunning. Currently, however, many of the fountains were empty and construction barriers were up so we didn't get to enjoy the full visual effect. \nThe restaurant itself though is beautiful, and huge! We went early so there was plenty of seating, and we got a nice booth by the wall. Our server was very nice and helped make a few wine suggestions for the three of us. \nThe bread and olive oil at the beginning was standard. No interesting crackers or garlic cloves in the olive oil or anything.\nFor entrees my dad ordered the gnocchi which he didn't finish....and he usually finishes everything.  My mom ordered the organic chicken which was a pretty big portion and she had enough to take home. I opted for the wild striped sea bass. I asked for it light on the oil/butter and our server informed me that it was cooked in parchment paper and essentially steamed so it would be lighter. I thought, oh that's great! However, when it arrived, there was a pool of oil at the bottom of the parchment paper. Bummer. \nIt was a nicely cooked piece of fish, but again too oily and the artichoke hearts that accompanied it were either very dry on the outer leaves or could've had a few more leaves trimmed off. The mushrooms with it were very nice but it did not come with any spring onions, as the menu indicated.\nOur server tried to \sell us\"" some dessert after we mentioned we were full, but overall we did like him. \nWe knew what the prices were like ahead of time,  but somehow, I don't feel like the food reflected the prices accurately.""",Awzz3kgm,1566

However, in all fairness, I must say I do not live in the neighborhood nor did I have the veal. But, I'll most definitely be trying the veal.

It was about 4:45 p.m. on a Saturday and we were seated immediately. Tucked into a strip mall, it immediately reminded us of the set-up of Pizza A Metro. After reviewing the menu, Robert walked over to Sprouts for wine and we ordered three bruschetta (slow-cooked pork ribs with tomato & melted mozzarella, pesto &fresh tomato and chevre & marinated sun-dried tomatoes) that were all extremely delicious. The bread remained firm and not soggy, yet not so hard that it hurt your teeth or cut the roof of your mouth.

There were places you could grab a drink and relax before the show. At our call time we went in and found our seats. We were up on the balcony in the fifth row pretty much right in the center. We had really good seats. The only thing about this theater that made me uncomfortable and keeps it from attaining that fifth star were first of all the seats. The backs were extremely straight and having a back condition it makes sitting up that straight difficult for long periods of time. The second thing that was a bit uncomfortable was the temperature of the theater. It was a bit warmer than I would have liked. I left coated in a film of sweat. Not pleasant. I was nervous I wasn't dressed appropriately having never been to the theater before, I went in jeans and a t-shirt, but I am glad now that I did because it would have been much more uncomfortable in one of my nice silk dresses than in jeans. \n\nHowever the show was hilarious. The part that made it for me was when one of the characters started singing the Rebecca Black \""Friday\"" song. Classic! Most of the people in the theater didn't get the reference so there were only a few pockets of young people laughing when it happened. But I found it to be a nice touch and after a play full of references I didn't get, I liked that there was something for us young folk thrown in. The rest of the show was funny, and I am glad that I got to experience it. \n\nAfter coming here I am interested in becoming more active in plays and am looking into seeing a ballet soon. All of us really enjoyed this, and I was surprised my husband liked this as much as he did. A good time had by all!""",kBw00VJw,2674

255,2018-03-06 07:17:03,"\The Old Spaghetti Factory\"" was probably one of the first restaurants my wife and I ate at when we started dating.  Money was tight back then and TOSF soon became one of our favorite eats.  I hate to compare this place to a fast food restaurant, but this place is like the \""McDonald's\"" of Italian food.  Now let me explain that.  When you go to McDonald's, it doesn't matter where in the country, or in the world, you are, when you order a cheeseburger, you know what you are going to get.  It's consistent and it's inexpensive.  The same can be said for TOSF.   It's decent quality Italian food, at very fair prices.  \n\nI've sampled many things on the menu over the years, but lately I always get the same thing when we go out for dinner; Spaghetti and Meatballs.  I know most people wouldn't think to order something that you can make at home out, but I like a good meat sauce and my wife would rather have marinara.  So, for me, it's a treat.  She adores the spaghetti with mizithra cheese and brown butter, although, last night she ordered the meatloaf and said she found a new favorite dish.  I'll have to try it next time.  I'm usually the one that goes for the \""soul food\"".  Dinner is usually served with a salad, and their creamy pesto dressing (similar to a ranch) is really amazing.  Remember to save a little room for desert, because you always get your choice of a scoop of ice cream, spumoni, or sherbet afterwards.\n\nTOSF is definitely kid friendly.  It is a true family restaurant.  The trolley car in the middle of the restaurant is always a draw with the little ones.  There can be a wait sometimes.  Call ahead and put your name on the list, since they don't take reservations.  The 1980's era arcade games are great to pass the time and bring back many memories of wasted quarters of my youth.  TOSF is one of those places that will always leave you full of good food and great memories...even if it is a chain.""",xcWAHhzF,2619

Hmm... considering I'm past my due date, I figured it couldn't hurt to get some of this stuff!\n\nI'd dined at Chakra 4 Vegetarian Restaurant once before and had a lovely experience... it's not my typical meal as everything there is vegetarian or vegan, but it's healthy and almost like a unique escape from my usual rotation of restaurants.  So, when I decided to search for Red Raspberry leaf tea, this place came to mind, and they delivered!\n\nJared joined me for lunch here, and I was pleasantly surprised that he really liked it... Maggie was our server and couldn't have been sweeter.  Jared started with an iced chai tea and ordered a wrap / soup combo for his meal.  I went with the Red Raspberry leaf tea and had \Chef Justin's Special Raw Living Raw Living Garden Burger\"" for my meal.  (See pic of menu description).  \n\nThe food here is pricey but I guarantee you will feel super healthy no matter what you order!  We opted out of dessert both visits, but there were plenty of delicious looking options to choose from, so save room if you'd like to end your meal with something sweet.\n\nI took some of the Red Raspberry leaf tea home with me and have been drinking a ton of it in hopes that I will have an easy labor/delivery real soon.

270,2018-04-14 11:52:49,"We got an incredible Groupon deal to stay at the Clarendon (three nights at $70 a night, including the $20 resort fee), and at that price this was certainly a four star experience.\n\nPROs: Bargain price, super friendly staff, clean rooms with the basics (king bed, flat-screen TV, mini-fridge, robes in-room), nice courtyard area with a large pool and jacuzzi, well-reviewed hotel-restaurant (although we didn't try it), and some nice freebees included in the hotel fee (covered parking, wi-fi, long distance/international calls, bottled water, a \late night munchies\"" minibar at the front desk, plus access to Gold's Gym Elite).\n\nCONs: The standard room was pretty sparse with white walls and black trim/furniture, cheap tile carpet, and the bathroom was tiny. Also, the rooms only have one small window, and the lighting is poor. The wi-fi was slow, and the on-site fitness center was small and sub-standard (at least two machines seemed to be broken). The room and hotel could also use some touch ups here and there, but most of these issues are pretty minor for the price.\n\nIf you were going to be spending a lot of time in your room, or if it were a work trip where fast wi-fi was essential, then the Clarendon's probably not for you. But for a vacation hotel where you're out and about 90% of the time, it has a lot to offer.

Its unavoidable to compare Chez Nous on Grand with Char's over on 7th Ave, so I will do a dual-analysis of these spots.\n\nTHE ATMOSPHERE:\nChar's is just a friendlier place.  Their doorman doesn't DEMAND his $5 like a put-out paperboy.  Chez's does.  Its kind of annoying and unsettling as your introduction to a night of hi-falutin drinking and lo-falutin boogieing.  Char's clientle seems to be in higher spirits and more polite as well.  Chez's are chilly.  Burrr.  If you stand in front of their seat to order a drink from the bar (because they went to go dance or something) they will let you know that you may NOT continue to stand there, even for a second.  The bartenders at both places are sweet and quick about their service.\n\nTHE DRINKS:\nWeak at both places, but IIRC, they are cheaper at Chez.  The no-card policy at Chez is a nuisance, so Char's is preferable here.  They both serve the typical booze and beer, so nothing really stands out other than the cost (Chez cheaper) and the convenience (Char's takes card).\n\nTHE MUSIC:\nThey are both MANIACALLY cool spots for some soul-funk-blues and great dance floors to boot.  This is the main reason to but up with any inconveniences, small or large, at either place.  \n\nTHE SET-UP:\nJust packed at both places.   If you want to come at a decent hour, you won't get a seat.  So, just forget about it.  Both buildings are pretty neat setups.  Chez is more of a railroad-style-room, and Chars more of a dance-hall set up.  Both have smoking patios, though Char's is small and quaint with tables and a busy atmosphere, while Chez's is (assuming) not complete and barren but large.  \n\nOVERALL:\nChar's Has the Blues AND the lead over Chez due to the fact that I can't seem to get over the vibe that I don't belong to \The Secret Club\"" ...shhhhh ... over at Chez.

Fruit to sugar cereal to nuts to crushed big brand candy available.\n\nThe quality is close enough to most of the relevant rivals (as long as one is not requiring the desert honey Sweet Republic tart variant) but, correctly and perhaps intentionally, the value proposition is that most patrons won't care about the slight dip, trading off for the flexibility of purchasing (only) as much yogurt and toppings as desired while satisfying Hershey's-acclimated children with a Frankenstein of saccharine flavors and junk toppings as well guests from the city pining for the nearest Pinkberry with original tart plus kiwi, strawberries, blackberries and pineapple.""",SOwyoQf3,3306

I had the carnitas taco special which was two tacos with rice and beans.  I specifically asked about what kind of tortillas the tacos were made with and the server said they were hard shell tacos.  When they arrived the tortillas were corn, greasy and soft.  Not so good.  My mom's soft tacos were strangely served upside down.

It just doesn't compute.\n\nYou walk in.  Wait in a line of about 15+ people with only 1 cash register (this just seemed unnecessary.  why can't i just sit down and someone take my order like every other not-that-great restaurant?), and then random people bring out your food, and random people wander around the dining area looking more interested in cleaning off tables, than on actually serving the diners.\n\nI had to ask like 3 \dining room attendants\"" for the same thing (just some salsa) before one of them actually returned after I'd basically finished.\nBut I had barely left my seat when they were already clearing off my dishes.\nThe service vibe just didn't go with the great food, decor and build up.\n\nI guess it's all about expectation.

349,2018-05-25 15:24:36,"STAY AWAY-unless you enjoy paying too much for used clothing that is often in very poor shape (I agree with other reviewers-overwhelming inventory and a lot of goodwill type digging to be done). But my biggest complaint is the \trade\"" system, read on:\n\nI used to love this store-I was quite loyal. However, now that the Scottsdale location has expanded, I have run into too many disappointments, First of all, requiring loyal customers (who LITERALLY provide the owner's inventory) to pay a $5.00 pick up fee for EACH item the client wants back (due to not selling-being marked down very low or what have) is BS. Although I realize that there is overhead and picking up has the potential for abuse, a system needs to be put in place that is more fair to the client. But, that's not what really bothers me: last time around I took in at least 50 items and they \""consigned\"" at least 30 of them. Some of these were designer pieces. They all get thrown into a bin and you never know what they are being marked at. I used to receive a decent cut, but now I can't help but feel that my items are just a few of many that get lost in the shuffle-I barely received anything (around $100) last time around and have no idea what my items sold for-it just all rings a bit fishy in my book. Other resale shops disclose your pricing on your items to you, not this place-they simply give you a paper that shows how many items they are taking. In addition, the prices have gone WAY up-must be to cover the rent of that huge space-it would be fine if the items were of stellar quality, but I find so many damaged (holes, stains, pilling etc.) on the clothing now that I don't even go into look. There are other options in town (and internet sources), and I plan on taking advantage of them in the near future.

350,2018-05-07 12:33:29,Wow. Thanks to my father I was able to find this hidden treasure. I love good Mexican food and the meal started out strong with great chips and salsa and guac. Service was good and one of the few bright spots. Then it was downhill. Food came out so fast and the meats lacked flavor or the ability to chew without hurting your jaw. Normally we take leftovers but I didn't want to put myself through any more pain. Just like a std,BrbSzXlF,2124
351,2018-02-25 00:03:53,"This is the place that we always seem to end up at when people come in to town for business. It's one of those places that's relatively convenient, has decent parking, and can handle larger crowds since they don't ever seem to be even remotely busy.\n\nI will agree that when I have been there with small, personal groups, service has been unbearably slow. They would definitely earn one more star if there were even a whiff of concern... but when the group is larger, we have always received exemplary service - dare I say size does matter?\n\nThe food is actually above standard, for its kind. I love the Santa Fe Stuffed Chicken Breast (it has lots of goat cheese inside and is covered in their red pepper cream sauce - which honestly I think would be good spread over an old leather sneaker). I could eat the Adovo Chicken Pasta twice a week and never get tired of it (same reference to red pepper cream sauce). My ex swore that the Meatloaf was the best (but really, what can't be improved by a generous portion of bacon?!!). And my all time favorite has to be Chile Rubbed Sirloin - it's flavorful, without being overpowering, always cooked exactly as requested, and generally requires the threat of forking when others realize that \it looks better than mine.\""\n\nIf you like Margaritas. You should be happy with what Sam's has to offer. The Orange Beso makes my toes tingle. Fortunately, they limit those to two servings - otherwise I might find myself behaving badly. They have several \""house margaritas\"" all of which I've enjoyed (really it's not my fault, I work with a lot of social alcoholics... it's the only way to deal with the stress).\n\nMy final offering is that this particular location (I haven't ever tried at the others, so they might be accommodating as well), is great for private functions. They will basically close down whatever portion of the restaurant you might need, either feed you buffet style or from the menu, work with you on drink coupons, let you hang corporate flair, etc.  If you are in a pinch for a business gathering in a relaxed environment give it a try.""",e56OtD9W,4758

I didn't go into the \family pool\"" - only the adult pool and it sufficed for my leisurely needs.  i did, however, advantage of the spa - see next review.  the buffet for breakfast was pretty good with it's selection of muffins, pancakes, etc... another added benefit to this resort is that it's walking distance from the mall right across the street with the tommy bahama's and the sushi place, some decent local shopping. although i would try to avoid walking around an outdoor mall in arizona in the summer.  they do their best to blow cold water on you as you walk around outside but sheesh, it does NOT do the trick.  you're plain baking and the shops look a lot less appetizing when you're on fire.  the resort itself though was very good.  4 stars.  location, pool, spa, bars, restaurants, everything you can ask for.  perhaps the only downside (which isn't a downside for some) was the high number of kids walking around everywhere.  if you're a business man on travel, it's torrible but if you're a couple looking for something romantic, it's not ideal .""",Womjao3e,1112

362,2018-03-31 01:02:49,"READ THE UPDATE AT THE END OF THIS POST!\n\nFour of us went to C4 for breakfast on Saturday. My wife and her friends have been there for breakfast several times on weekdays, so it was strange the server's only excuse for what you are about to read was \We've just started the new breakfast menu recently, so we're still working it out.\"" My wife says they have been serving this very menu for about a month, so it is hard to understand how a place that apparently has their act together for lunch and dinner can't manage a decent breakfast service.\n\nMy wife and I ordered a burrito, pancakes and red potato home fries to share. The server said they were out of reds, but the chef could still slice up some white potatoes and make some home fries. As for pancakes, they \""had made some earlier, but they were bad\"", so no pancakes for us. The home fries were half-cooked, with no browning whatsoever, totally unacceptable.\n\nOne of our guests ordered a traditional breakfast of eggs, bacon, home fries and apple juice. They were out of apple juice. The bacon was limp and soft and the home fries were half-cooked, like ours.\n\nOur other guest ordered the chiliquiles and was the only one of us happy with the breakfast. One out of four is not good enough! \n\nI have never been to any restaurant that serves breakfast, but does not have the most common items (listed on their menu), such as home fries, pancakes or the juice the server offered. What a shame - 50 bucks for a bad start to a good day. Somebody needs to do do a better job of ordering and prepping.\n\nUPDATE: The apology I have received from the owner since my first post is all it takes for me to accept that this was a rare incident, probably just \""one of those days\"". Since my wife had not previously had a problem on any of her previous visits, she was quite embarrassed when she finally convinced me to give the place a try and then something like this happens. Mistakes happen and good restaurants correct them. I now think it fair to post the rating my wife would give them based on her past experience, and that would be 4 star.""",tIPwiFV3,3902

It's like a bus station.  There are sad-looking people on benches, huddled together for moral support, crying in the corner, and laying in a puddle on the floor.  I relegated myself to sit by a wobbly-looking display with outdated products, hoping I'd be left alone to wait out my sentence.\n\nI have rarely seen the likes of the despair that I saw in my two hours of waiting in the Verizon store.

I watched a person pick off a really large scab. I saw a really together-looking dude get to the point of a breakdown when a rep jumped another customer in front of him in the queue. I mean, there was almost a brawl. I saw three crickets, a spider and a roach... and this was all before my name was called.\n\nThe service rep could not, no, WOULD not, fix my phone.

408,2018-02-03 01:03:15,"Wow. Even Lafayette, LA born Hubby was seriously impressed with Flavors of Louisiana. The restaurant was far from full on a Saturday night, but the customers came in steadily. It is a small place, but very clean, and rather sparsely decorated. At least you can taste right away where their priorities are. \n\nHubby had the special of the night- three pieces of tender, perfectly cooked catfish smothered in crawfish etoufee. He had asked for, and was told that he would receive etoufee only, but got the special anyway. He loved it, but this mix-up is the reason for the 4 stars. Even though it was in a darker roux, which he normally does not prefer, he licked his plate clean. I got the shrimp po'boy which came in a large basket with fries. It was two 6\ halves of a fresh baguette with lettuce, tomato, a zippy sauce, and plenty of perfectly cooked battered and fried shrimp. Our dining companions had an equally huge and tasty fried oyster po'boy, a side of fresh and tangy cole slaw, and a bowl of delicious seafood gumbo. Nothing was spicy, just super flavorful. The boys got the peach cobbler dessert, and even though we girls both said we didn't much care for peach cobbler, we certainly helped the boys polish off the big bowls when they got to the table. \n\nEven though FOL is quite a drive for us, we will be back very soon. Please note that as of October 1, 2009, they will be closing early on Saturday nights- 8:00 instead of 9:00 PM.""",oiuBVfxh,2942

411,2018-01-06 15:33:51,Wow!  This place is amazing.  So amazing I went there twice in a week.  I will start with my dinner.\n\nThe ambiance was great.  The place has a nice warm feeling to it and since it was cold outside it was really nice.  They had a large fireplace inside and after dinner we stayed for the great crowd that showed up and went outside.  It was pretty chilly but I didn't even notice as the fire pit was big enough to warm everyone around it.  They also had ample heat lamps.  \n\nThe food was fantastic.  I had the tomato soup with the grilled cheese crouton in it and it warmed me up and prepped me for my main meal.  I had the burger and tender belly bacon.  This was an amazing treat for my taste buds.  The bacon was not like any bacon I have had on a burger.  It was a perfect complement for each other.  I wanted another one when I was done but couldn't possibly eat anymore. \n\nThe drinks were great.  They have an amazing wine selection.  The wines we were drinking were affordable and it looks like they really spent some time picking the right wines to carry.  They have some really nice wines that rival the selection of some of the really nice wine bars in Scottsdale as well.  My friends said that the mixed drinks were really well made and they were very happy with how they turned out.  They have just about everything you could want for mixed drinks.\n\nService was amazing as well.  They were really attentive and the owner stopped by to talk to our table.  \n\nLunch\n\nThe lunch was just as good as the dinner.  I had a shrimp BLT that rivals anything in AZ.  I was glad to see that had a variety of Dr. Pepper/Mr. Pibb on tap.  It was really relaxing to sit there at lunch and enjoy the crowd.  The service was excellent.\n\nOverall I highly recommend Vintage 95 for lunch or dinner.  It is a great place for a date at night and you can enjoy the great crowd afterwards with great conversation and ambiance to fit.,RP0MmPTN,3014
412,2018-02-16 12:21:09,"He said, \I made dinner reservations.\""  And so I was nervous.  It was a dinner date to celebrate my birthday, albeit 4 days later, and I was excited to try a new place. A foodie always gets excited about new culinary adventures!  That is, until he uttered the restaurant name \""Crudo.\""  I sat there bummed.  He asked if I had heard of the place he was dying to try, and I said yes (in a disappointed voice).  Why didn't my friend ask ME where I wanted to go on my birthday I thought!  Deciding not to ruin the night by sounding like a little brat, I quickly changed my tune as soon as we parked in the lot outside the swanky LA looking streetside facade.  \n\nWe walked in the restaurant and I immediately felt calm.  Perhaps it was the dark wood floors, exposed ceiling or even the tranquil ambiance - I don't know, but what I do know is that I was excited to be there.  We were immediately taken to the dining area where she allowed us to choose the table of our choice.  We were then greeted by our kind waiter where she happily took us through the drink menu (offering up their mixologist's specialties should we not see something on the menu we'd prefer) and explained to us the Crudo dining experience.  The experience is not like many restaurants; at Crudo your options include 3, 4 or 5 courses.  \n\nCrudo offers 4 selections for each of its 4 categories, if you will.  Crudo/Raw being the first, followed up with Mozza/Mozzarella, then Cotto/Cooked, and then Griglia/Grilled....and lastly (the 5th), Dolce which means dessert if you've saved any room for it which is highly unlikely.\n\nWe had a hard time deciding (thankfully our waiter helped navigate based on both our preferences), but decided to split four courses as follows:\n\nCrudo/Raw - yellowtail - controne, bottarga, iitoi at $12 (who knows what all that means, but I do know I loved it and dreaded the last bite)\n\nMozza/Mozzarella - Burrata - crisp pancetta, vinaigrette and fresh arugula at $10\n\nCotto/Cooked - Mushroom - mozzarella, truffle, egg at $16\n\nGriglia/Grilled - Short Rib - grilled root veg, shaved horseradish at $18\n\nIt was just enough savory bites to leave me content and wanting to try more of what Crudo offers.  One thing I do want to note is how our waiter informed us that since we decided to split four courses we would be charged at the a la carte price verse the 4 course cost, and she informed us at order time instead of leaving us shocked when the bill was dropped.  Thank you.  \n\nI couldn't have been more wrong about my initial thoughts on the drive to dinner that evening.  Since that night I have been waiting for a reason to return and savor their ricotta, risotto, dumpling, gnocchi and porkbelly dishes to name a few.  Thank you, Crudo, for proving me wrong and making a fan out of me and now anyone and everyone I recommend to your foodie loving establishment.\n\nAnd to those who are on the fence about going to Crudo because of the limited menu, just go - you will LOVE it.""",GYjuILcS,2133

420,2018-04-11 15:41:00,"The first time we tried Lucky's was maybe six years ago. I didn't like it then. Hard to remember what we ordered, perhaps a Sicilian style, but either the crust or sauce or something else turned us off and we decided not to go back. Until a couple of weeks ago, when, having exhausted just about every other food place in Surprise two dozens times over, I came up with the jolly idea of getting us some Lucky's again based on all the good reviews. And I hated it just as much this time around as the first. UGH.\n\nThe only positive thing I can say about this place is that they give you a ~monstrous~ amount of pizza. Imagine a large pizza box precisely filled with a giant square BRICK of a pizza, easily an inch and a half tall and cut into square slices. That's what we got. I'd say it was over 3 pounds of pizza; flavorless and gross. I found it breathtaking that it had that little taste. This was a supreme pizza that tasted through and through like I was eating play-doh. Olives, sauce, cheese, crust, the works. To top it off, the mushrooms were slimy, canned champignons and not fresh at all, and tasted as though they'd just been pulled out of someone's nose. I've had some pretty bad pizza in my time, most of them I'd liken to eating chewy, dry cardboard. This was the first one that was this big and relatively succulent and STILL tasted gross.\n\nI stomached maybe six slices over two sorry-ass sittings before throwing about 2/3 of the pizza away. Two pounds' worth of \food\"", down the sh1tter. I don't know where the mass delusion about this place comes from, but I'll never return. If I want a gutbuster special, especially now that Bronco Billy's is gone, I'll head to Rays just down the road instead. Plus, Lucky's is overpriced. A large and a smaller pizza cost us $30. Most of the smaller pizza was thrown away too - I didn't try any of that one so I'm not reviewing it, but the wife said she was incredibly unimpressed with it, and it was just a plain cheese. If it all tasted good it would have been worth it - I'd have paid that and more for a Chuck Wagon Special from Billy's - but the lack of flavour and value drops my rating of this joint to a bottom-of-the-barrel single star. And just for proverbials and giggles: http://www.maricopa.gov/envsvc/envwebapp/tabs/results.aspx?navigatedFrom=inspectionResultsDrillDownAA&permit=FD-05766&business=Lucky's%20Pizza&address=15508%20W%20Bell%20Rd%20Suite%20207&insp_id=3182324""",yAbbK85p,876

430,2018-01-03 15:48:01,"Frankly, this is some of the priciest Chinese food I've ever had. Got takeout the other day for 3 adults. Spent nearly $75 and it simply wasn't worth it. Our order had 4 appetizers and 3 entrees. \n\nThere were supposed to be 4 potstickers but there were only 3. At $5.25, those 3 dumplings were pricey. Apparently somebody in the kitchen has trouble counting because our $4.50 order of crab puffs was also missing one (ie, it had 4 instead of 5). The Teriyaki beef skewers (you get 4 of them) were dry, dry dry. They were like eating beef jerky on a stick, only these were tasteless. They were tough and way overcooked or maybe they had just been sitting around for a few days. Definitely not worth $2 a piece. \n\nThe honey dipped ribs (4 of them) were a nice size but a little tough. The bbq sauce covering the ribs was tomato-based and I expected it to be a little sweet (it is called HONEY DIPPED ribs, after all) but it was pretty bland. I did not taste sweet on those ribs. The portion was a good size for an appetizer, though. \n\nThe Walnut Shrimp was probably the smallest portion of the entrees and way overpriced. I could count on 4 fingers the number of average size shrimp in there. They were stingy with the walnuts and veggies as well. The portion appeared to be child-sized or maybe a half portion but it was most definitely NOT worth almost $16. \n\nThe Beef and Broccoli was supposed to be prepared in a garlic brown sauce (according to the menu). The sauce had a light reddish tinge (maybe from some tomato sauce?) and there was no garlic flavor in this sauce. There was very little flavor of any kind. I expected to taste soy sauce, ginger, even pepper but nothing. I've had Beef and Broccoli at other restaurants before and I've also made it at home and this was the blandest by far. The broccoli was fresh and had a nice crunch and color to it and the beef was tender but cut into miniscule pieces, as if by cutting them so small and spreading them around, it'll look like you have a lot more beef than you actually do. At $13.50, the portion size was adequate for one person even though there seemed to be more broccoli and very little beef. \n\nFinally, the House Fried Rice was the only dish that actually had some flavor to speak of. The aroma and color of the entree was appetizing. But, there was maybe 3 small shrimp, some chicken and pork and plenty of veggies. The portion was large so for almost $10 you get enough fried rice for maybe a couple of meals. \n\nAdditionally, I wasn't given (or offered) any packets of soy sauce (or any other sauce) or chopsticks. I suppose you just have to know to ask for what you want before you walk out. I also had to wait an additional 15 minutes longer than the \20 to 30 minutes\"" I was told it would take on the phone. \n\nI wouldn't order takeout from this place again much less actually go and eat there. The food is overpriced, mediocre and flavorless. They're also stingy with their main ingredients, particularly the shrimp and beef. If you like overpaying for mediocre chinese food, this is the place to go.""",cSzyuOVN,665

I took my daughter and 3 of her friends there for her 16th birthday, and we all are absolutely in love with this place! The first thing I love is that they are on Restaurants.com, which means I was able to purchase a $50 gift certificate for the low, low price of $4. Yes, that's right, $4! (Thanks to a fab sale that Restaurants.com has every so often.) \n\nWe arrived and were seated by the owner's daughter, who was delightfully pleasant and informed us that her mom is in the kitchen cooking. That was our first indication that the food was going to be magnificent. Who doesn't want a good home-cooked meal from someones mom? Love it! We started off with 2 orders of the #13 appetizer. I can't remember the name of it, but it is a sampler appetizer, with some hummus, babbaganouj (please don't be dis-swayed my lack of spelling ability), tabbouleh, a yogurt spread/dip, feta cheese, olives and fresh, warm pita bread. SO GOOD! My faves were the babbaganouj, which had a perfect smokey flavor to it, and the tabbouleh, which was deliciously fresh. \n\nEVERYONE at the table enjoyed the meals. I ordered the mixed grill and was more than happy with the flavor in the chicken, gyro and lamb. Plus the rice was really good too! I was only one at the table to have the lentil soup with my meal, and OMG, it was perfect! Nice and creamy, without being too thick. The other meals we had were the curry chicken, vegetarian falafel, chicken shawirma and the gyros. Like I said, everyone loved everything! \n\nI will definitely be back!""",7NbUxHGJ,2165

I've been here one other time, but I had 18 too many cocktails and couldn't taste the sushi, story of my life.  \n\nHowever, I was able to taste the sushi last night and was very disappointed.  I know they also own Geisha A Go Go (or Geisha owns them, whatever) and that's one of my fav Scottsdale places, so I had some big hopes for Stingray.  Here is why I gave 2 stars:\n\n1) Choice of rolls and creativity of rolls was subpar.  I had cooler rolls where I lived in Lansing, Michigan...c'mon, this is The Biltmore, gimme something more exciting than the \Spicy Crab Roll\"".\n2) Appetizer we had wasn't good.  We ordered the scallop and mushroom (which the waitress said was 'AMAZING, like OMG\"") so don't order that.\n3) Wine was good...$7-10/glass...bright spot of the night.\n\nOverall - it was just an \""ok\"" experience...spent $72 (pre-tip) on 3 rolls, appetizer and 2 glasses of wine.  Not worth it in my opinion, much better sushi places like Blue Wasabi in Phx/Gilbert and even Hana I like better in Central Phoenix.""",h5suwXeJ,1861

In addition I also wanted to see about making an appointment to meet / interview any of their doctors at this location. \n\nAccording to the gal at the front desk, none of the doctors at this location do interviews or meet and greets. She told me I could view their profiles on their website. That doesn't really provide a feel for the doctor other than what they can do or have done - doesn't show the type of bedside manner or even if you will like them. Being in the hospital with a newborn and a first time mom is not the time I would like to find out that I hate my child's doctor. \n\nI was told I could go to their Tempe location and interview the doctors there but none of the Tempe doctors work at this location. So how does that help me to choose a doctor at the location I was at and she said that it really didn't. \n\nShe did mention that other people have left their pediatricians to go to their office but not being able to meet with them to see why, that isn't enough for me to choose them as my doctor's office for my child. \n\nThen she said that I could ask around and see what other people thought of this location but of course they can't provide a list of people who go to their offices. Why even mention that??? What was the point of that? \n\nI was so frustrated by that conversation. \n\nIf you are currently interviewing pediatricians, you can cross this one off of your list of phone calls and drop-ins since the doctors will not meet with anyone who is not a current patient. \n\nI did ask a few of my friends who do have children about my experience and they did tell me this is unusual or they have not heard of this happening. \n\nSo if the doctor that I do wind up taking my child to doesn't work out, I'll interview with other pediatricians before I even think about taking my child here.""",ioZdvHDy,4814
467,2018-06-06 08:14:56,Went to grab some sushi with Jared R. tonight.  He recommended this place from reading the reviews on here.  We started off with the miso soup which was pretty good.  Lots of Tofu and the broth had a nice flavor.  We both ordered some sake bombers to gulp down with our meal.  \n\nWe got 5 rolls which were all really good.  The first set was the yellowfin roll and the fiery shrimp.  They both were really good.  The fiery shrimp was exactly as the name said.  It had just the perfect amount of kick and shrimp.  \n\nThe next roll to come out was the Tsunami Roll which was my favorite.  It had a fried outside and lots of flavor.  The sauce that came on the plate was more than just a decoration.  \n\nLastly we had the big and spicy roll and the spicy tuna roll.  They both had a great amount of kick.  The big and spicy was very good and the best part was the pickled jalapenos on the top.  \n\nOverall this place was really good and I would totally go back again.

469,2018-01-02 06:20:40,"The stadium formerly known as 'The BOB' (Bank One Ballpark) changed its name after Bank One was acquired and the new owner had a man crush on Phillies 2B Chase Utley.\n\nIt would actually be more fitting if they swapped sponsors with the Phoenix Suns' US Airways Center as this baseball stadium feels like being in an airplane hangar thanks to the retractable roof.  Unlike most roofs, it is flat versus being dome-shaped.  While domes already feel wrong, the fact the roof isn't even dome-shaped makes it worse.  The biggest downside to the flat roof (which would seemingly be more efficient for opening/closing) is that the whole stadium needs to be built at the same height all around where the best stadiums have a high backdrop behind home plate and down the lines but provide open views in the outfield (e.g., AT&T Park in SF, PNC Park in Pittsburgh, Wrigley Field in Chicago).  The huge scoreboard in centerfield is pretty cool but the black backdrops in RF and LF are claustrophobia-inducing eyesores.\n\nOne might feel compelled to wonder why there's a need for a dome since it rarely rains in AZ.  The reason for the dome, however, is b/c the summer temperatures reach a level that meteorologists and climatologists term \hot as balls\"".  With the dome on, though, I'm sure it's comfortable as they can cool it with AC and the many swings and misses from DiamondHacks like Mark Reynolds and Chris B (Krispie) Young.  \n\nThe inside of the stadium is build similar to most modern stadiums with an open concourse throughout that allows you to watch the game on your way to the concessions or restroom.\n\nThe outfield fences are virtually symmetrical at 330' down the lines, 375' in the gaps and 410' in centerfield.  CF has a high, confusing black wall with a yellow line dictating what is fair or foul.  RF and LF are normal in height.  The stadium is considered to be a 'hitter's park' but this is probably more due to the climate than the fence distances  (baseballs travel in heat).\n\nThe food offerings are just okay.  There is BBQ but it didn't look as good as Boog's in Baltimore, Orlando Cepeda's in SF, or Randy Jones' in SD.  This could be because the BBQ isn't served out in the open over flames or because no ex-player runs it.  My suggestion - launch a Randy Johnson's Surly BBQ Mullet Pit behind the outfield stands.  I went with an Italian Sausage sandwich from the Hungry Hill Sangwich cart.  Despite it hailing from sausage-lovin' Chicago, I didn't think it was so good - had no real spice to it.  They also had Polish Sausage and Italian Beef at the cart.  Enjoyed Gordon Biersch garlic fries later in the game.  They have a FatBurger there.  Good beer selection available throughout the place.\n\nIf there is one thing the park is known for, it's the pool and hot tub behind the RF fence.  I only saw one kid in teh pool the day I went and no one was in the hot tub.  This may have something to do with the sign that reads \""No lifeguard on duty.  Swim and have non-consentual sex with Diamondback bullpen members at your own peril\"".  Not very family friendly if you ask me.  \n\nLocated in downtown Phoenix, there are some decent drinking and eating options nearby including a renowned pizzeria (Pizzeria Bianco).    If I lived in the area, I'd totally see a few games a year.  But if you're dutifully trying to catch games in the most memorable ballparks, it's okay to leave this one off.""",bB3TMMKn,2424

Once we arrived, it didn't take long for them to set up our table in the outdoor patio. When the first four of us sat down, the server came by to take our drink order. We asked for water while we waited for the rest of the group and the server actually rolled his eyes at us and said, \okay\"" in that snooty voice. I asked him if there was a problem with our drink order and he laughed and said no. Maybe he thought he was being funny and joking with us but it did not come out that way. A few more girls joined and by that time the servers went ahead and brought water for everyone. 15-20 minutes after they brought our waters, our server still hadn't come back to see if we wanted to order bar drinks and/or food.  We had to go up to the bar, where he was standing, and tell him he were ready. About 5 minutes later, he came to take everyone's order. After that, we barely saw him. I ordered the ceviche and the guacamole appetizer. I thought the guacamole app would just be a bowl of guacamole but it came with refried beans and chips. That was a nice surprise because I was worried about having to order extra chips and be charged for them (per other Yelp reviews). The guacamole was pretty good and I can throw down on that stuff. I also thought the salsa they brought out was extremely good. My ceviche was...interesting. I love ceviche and ordered it with the intent of something light. It came out on two tostadas with the shrimp, avocado, and salsa layered on each tostada. I definitely did not expect that but I guess that it their twist on ceviche. I found the ceviche to be very saucy, as well, almost as if it had ketchup mixed with the tomatos. It was also pretty spicy. After eating the first tostado, I just ate the toppings off the others with a fork. I liked my ceviche at Frank & Lupe but not if I knew it was ceviche. I looked around at the girls' dishes and I will say they looked pretty good. We also ordered pitchers of their house margarita ($24 each) which I thought was pretty good.

489,2018-02-21 10:37:22,"I'm glad I took the trip here on my first day in the Phoenix area. It took me a while looking around to find a restaurant to go to and this place certainly made the effort worthwhile. In fact, I believe this is a must-go place if you are ever visiting Phoenix or its surrounding suburbs. \n\nLocation and ambiance:\nIt's located in the Heritage Park, so your car actually cannot get anywhere close to the building. You can either do street parking or park in the heritage garage, which I think at least a part of it gets validated (at least that's what it seemed like when the server asked me while i was paying whether or not i parked in the garage). I did street parking and walked through the park, which was rather enjoyable. I didn't find the actual restaurant ambiance all that impressive though but i guess you cant do much when it's inside a historic building. \n\nFood:\nI had an idea of what i wanted to order when i checked their website, but both fortunately and unfortunately, it turned out to be restaurant week in Arizona (yes apparently all of arizona had restaurant week at the same time) and the selection was limited to the restaurant week menu ($40 for three courses) and a otherwise rather dismal selection of the original dinner menu. I had wanted to have the Washyugyu short rib, but they only offered this waguyu beef that wasn't offered as a part the prix fixe menu, and there was nothing on this menu to pair it with, so knowing that their portions are small, i had to go with the fixed price menu, which turned out to be quite good.\n\nThey start you out with a mixed plate of SNAP PEAS, SHASITO PEPPERS, HOUSE KIMCHI, and a GAZPACHO type SOUP. The kimchi was my favourite, than the soup. The rest were okay.\n\nFor my first course, I chose the SHIROMI CARPACCIO, which was a white sashimi fish that is served with hot flavoured oil poured on top in front of you and paird with house-made foccacia. The flavour of the oil includes \ginger, yuzu kosho, sesame oil, garlic\"" and their faccacia is fused with herb. Together, the combination really opens up your appetite. I dont like sashimi, but this I ate all. \n\nFor the second course, I was suggested the LOBSTER ROLL, since it's not often on their menu. To be honest, I was a tiny bit disappointed since I was promised that it was going to be phenomenal and I got just very good. The lobster roll had minimal mayonnaise (which is good IMO) but it also had more vegetables than lobster. What I did find amazing was that although there appeared to be a lot of celery in there, the flavour did not overcome the dish and you barely taste the celery, just the crunchy texture. I wasn't a fan of the lukewarm sweet bread in place of a real roll. It also comes with a tiny bowl of bisque, which is the sauce they seem to use in the roll as well. The bisque was mediocre, but the fresh chives really added flavour to the whole thing. \n\nFor the last course, dessert, I got the japanese pastry mix, which came with a BLACK SESAME BRULEE, ORANGE MOUSSE, and a CREAM PUFF. I generally don't like the black sesame flavour, but the brulee was so good I ate every last bite. The Orange mousse was served in an orange peel. At first bite it was a bit too tangy, but the more you ate, the better it taste. It also helped that there were pulp inside the mousse, which gave it amazing texture. I saved the cream pouf for last because it was my favourite. It was your average cream puff but carved in a way that looks like a picnic basket, and served with fresh strawberries , which really kicked the puff up a notch. \n\nI loved the fact that this place can take a regular japanese dish and kick it up a notch by adding such simple things. \n\nService:\nMy main server was okay. She wasn't all that nice, but was helpful in suggestions as she took my order. There were 3-4 people that served dishes, took my bill, etc., and they were all extremely friendly and made you feel really welcome. The host who ended up taking my bill was very chatty with me and thanked me for dropping by on my first day in Phoenix. \n\nI really hope to come back again in the next few days.""",kdJst14N,2074
490,2018-03-09 21:52:38,"We've been loyal customers of Elements for several years.  The food has always been incredible, as has the service, and we were happy to pay the prices for the total experience.  The last few times, however, it seems to have changed.  The menu is now much less friendly to those with allergies, and though the restaurant management sends out emails informing of the new gluten-free friendly menu, it is really non-existant.  At brunch a little while back, we were told that we couldn't order just a plain omelette or a few eggs with fruit without purchasing the entire buffet brunch. It was really a \fight' to get them to accommodate our needs...they seemed to be put out that we would ask for \""special service\"" when so much of the buffet was full of wheat products that we couldn't eat.  Last night, we went for dinner and it was much of the same story.  The cocktail waitress who helped us really tried hard, but she kept saying \""they can make pretty much anything you want gluten free\"".  She would go to the kitchen and come back saying that the kitchen couldn't alter any of the things we ordered.  They told us we could have 2 things on the menu.  When we ordered one of them, she came back yet again and said \""the chef thinks you'd like this dish better\"".  It was really odd and quite annoying, considering the prices we pay for meals there.  We aren't the only ones in town to have this allergy...time to get with the program, Elements, like so many of your competitors.  \n\nIt saddens me to say this, but I think from now on, we'll just be going to Jade Bar for cocktails, then leaving to eat at places that have a flexible kitchen/chef and menu.   We aren't the only ones in town to have this allergy...time to get with the program, Elements, like so many of your competitors.  We will miss the Elements of the past.""",ZXJNVvi7,4882

I finally went along with my hubby and 5 year old son about 5 months ago for the first time and have gone to several since then.  We absolutely loved it!  We parked around Tammie Coe's Bakery (that's how we came to visit this joint so often) and order some coffee and dessert while we walked around.\n\nArtlink definitely revived what was once a seedy part of downtown into something so unique to Phoenicians.  Old and dilapidated bungalows were transformed into jewelry, pottery, and sculpture enclaves.  Headlining local bands performing in front yards...so cool!

497,2018-02-09 18:13:07,"Cowboy Ciao is a perfect example of a restaurant that teeters between 3 and 4 stars. A lot of things we tried here were good, but the likelihood that I'll fly to Phoenix just so I can get my hands on their cuisine is highly unlikely. To distill: It's good, but not that special. \n\nNevertheless, the meal I shared was enjoyable. Things I didn't think I'd like (mushroom pan fry w/ polenta) I really liked, and things I thought I'd love (chopped salad) weren't enjoyable. The chopped salad everyone raves about has smoked salmon, which is on my list of nastiest ingredients for a salad ever. \n\nThe shrimp and grits \grazing\"" plate was yummy, but neither the best shrimp nor the best grits I'd ever tried. My entree was the Puerco Lento, a braised pork shank in southwestern spicing, and it was okay but disappointing. The meat was not as tender as it could be and it seemed to be served atop a queso fundido soup with slices of potato. Whoever thought that was the best preparation for this dish has interesting and white-trashy taste. Velveeta, anyone?\n\nOur server was very nice and to my delight Cowboy Ciao serves bottled Diet Coke (a delicious rarity). The restaurant has dim but appropriate lighting, yet the atmosphere is on the casual and cold side. The menu struck me as upscale eclectic and unpretentious, but the taste tended to be heavy handed and their execution wasn't the best. \n\nIt's possible that I'd come back here, but for vacationers (like I was), I'd recommend going elsewhere. This isn't special or great enough to visit when you're in the city for only a few days.""",95WgDXRB,2955

499,2018-01-02 18:09:54,"I've been to Lux twice since they've made the move next door, and I figured it was ok to give a review. I have been to Lux countless times over the last few years. It has always been the place to see and be seen, with coffee service that is definitely above Starbucks, but I will admit struggles in certain areas. \n\nLux, in its former space, was a small shop, always packed and definitely had its crowd. If you weren't a part of the crowd, you'd receive a \look\"" of, \""hey, who are you?!\"" Look past that and hop in line for a cappuccino and it would make up for it.\n\nThe new space, well... it caters to the exclusivity of the \""hipster\"" crowd. Walk through the door that you THINK is the entrance... and wander around. The kitchen, espresso bar and cocktail bar are all broken up and there is no definitive flow of service. Also, is that a customer wearing the tight jeans and cardigan? Or is that the staff? Who knows? Luckily I have a friend who works there and was kind enough to show me around and how the flow of service works. If you're not that lucky, best of luck to you, as you're left to your own sense of direction as how to order, sit down, etc. From what I gather, you can order an espresso drink and sit wherever and they'll call your name when your drink is ready. However, I'm not sure about the cocktail bar. The only way I think you would order would be by sitting at the bar? Not sure about ordering food from the kitchen.\n\nI will admit, I haven't ordered any food from Lux yet, apart from a pastry for my coffee. I had a croissant, which was pretty good and went really well with my cappuccino. I'm a fan of a free-pour cappuccino, however the cappuccino that I was served on this visit had the foam scooped on top. This confused me, because I saw other customers order a cappuccino and get one free-pour. Maybe it depends on the barista? Kind of inconsistent. I did sit down at the awkward cocktail bar and order a drink. The bar has normal height seating and a raised bar for the bartender. It's awkward when they lean down and tower over you to deliver a drink. Anyway, I ordered the \""Number 47\"" cocktail with gin, Green Chartreuse, St. Germain, lime, mint and cucumber. I'm a huge fan of Green Chartreuse and gin so I was excited to try it. They didn't have any cucumber in house, so they made it without it. Jeff (the owner) commented, \""Well today it's just the 46.\"" Hmm... Alright. So I took a sip of the cocktail. It was decent. Nothing exciting at all. It was overpowered by the mint and the lime in the cocktail. It masked the green Chartreuse too much. It really NEEDED that cucumber to mellow out the mint and lime so you could taste all of the ingredients.\n\nOh well... what can you do when the owner doesn't seem to mind that ingredients are missing? \n\nOverall, props to Lux for being busy at 3pm on a Thursday afternoon and being a successful establishment, which may be from the same established clientele from before the expansion. The coffee and pastry has remained the same, which is ok with me. However, the cocktail bar tries a little too hard, I think. Also, the decor and vibe has definitely turned Lux into the \""hipster mecca\"" and excluded the general public from it's demographic. Which, I can't complain or comment too much, because they are doing just fine. The flow of the restaurant is choppy and confusing and the staff is less than considerate (with a few exceptions). There's my two cents, for whatever it's worth.""",4pEYGpdQ,1762

It's a cramped little place, every free space crammed with tables.  The decor is working toward slighty upscale and strangely fits in well with the neighborhood.  \n\nWhile I've had to wait for tables before, the service has always been moderately fast for the size of the crowed.  The wait staff have found that perfect balance between 'hovering and annoying' and 'ignoring and annoying'.  This is definitely a positive.\n\nEverything is flavorful and the food is high quality, however it's slightly too sweet for my taste.  Like, way too sweet.  The yellow curry, usually my favorite Thai dish, could definitely lose whatever ingredient adds the sickeningly sweet flavor.  I've had the same issue with the namesake dish.\n\nI usually forget how mild they are with the spices between visits and order my meal \""medium\"".  Using the phrase \""extra super super hot\"" has been the only method I've found to have them add enough chili, and that almost takes the edge off of the sweetness.\n\nThe food is always consistent and you know what you're getting.  The portions are a bit small for the price.  The Thai iced tea and desserts absolutely win, though this may not be surprising since they're supposed to be sweet.""",UXXJ0PNa,1739

Being my first time in a Wingstop, I know I had that \deer in the headlights\"" look on my face. Unfortunately, the young lady working the counter didn't notice that I might need some help, because she was counting down her cash register so she could go home.\n\nNow, I'm relatively bright, and I'm extremely literate, so I figured out what I wanted after a little searching...though, I would have been open to suggestions instead of standing there for five minutes trying to decide what sounded the most palatable.\n\nI ended up getting the 10 wing bone-in meal with fries and a drink for about $11. I opted for the regular \""Hot\"" flavored wings, though they did have a decent variety from which to choose if you think you have the gastrointestinal fortitude to palate them. Speaking from former decisions with crazily spiced wings, I do NOT recommend anything rated higher than good 'ol \""hot\"".\n\nThe wings and fries came out as quickly as could be expected. The wings themselves weren't bad. The \""hot\""was an excellent choice. Not too spicy, not too bland...just right for my liking. \n\nThe fries, though...they were a different story. There were three different levels of french fries in my basket:\n\n1) Just Right\n2) Uncooked\n3) Burnt to a Crisp\n\nOn top of the inconsistency with the fries, they were WAY over salted...almost to the point of not being edible.\n\nThe only saving grace for this place was the fact that they were airing the inaugural game of the 2012 NFL season.

Many of them have converted to the take out/delivery only format. \n\nI was thrilled to see a sit down pizza hut in Casa Grande.

557,2018-02-21 02:04:03,"I want to like Carlos O'Brien's. Because it's basically within walking distance of my house. I really do want to like it. Unfortunately, I don't. Don't get me wrong, everything I've had here is passable, but nothing really shines.\n\nFirst off, the name. Carlos (Latin) O'Brien's (Irish). In the spirit of, say, Chino Bandido's, I think it's reasonable to expect that the food at O'Brien's should have a Latin-Irish mashup. Spicy Irish classics? That could be cool! But no, they don't do this. As a matter of fact, the place might as well be called Carlos Martinez' - because there's nothing on the menu at all even remotely Irish. This is a straight-up \Mexican\"" sit-down restaurant experience that seems to be trying to emulate Macayo's.\n\nAnd this is why they fail. While their food is as palatable as Macayo's in many respects, none of its acoutrements (those things that take Macayo's to another level) are polished enough to service what is, in the end, bland Ameri-Mexican food. Chimichangas? Check. Mini-version-of-everything appetizer plate? Check. But their taco meat tastes almost like straight beef, their rice and beans sucks, their salsa is bland and boring, their guacamole is tasteless (and expensive) and their sour cream is weirdly salty. Their salads are uninteresting afterthoughts. I dream about Macayo's' Fiesta Salad - the salads here all taste like Denny's salads put in a tortilla bowl.\n\nIn short, if you want some unique Mexican food, go local. Go authentic. Even if you're looking for something to satisfy your American craving for strip-mall chain-food Mexican, you can do better than this.""",mrZQbNpc,892

It may sound petty, but the parking situation can sometimes be a dealbreaker for me.  I can't be alone on this or else it wouldn't be mentioned in the primary description for any place listed here on Yelp.  \n\nAside from that, this and any other Wildflower Bread Co. location is definitely worth a visit for something different.  Don't leave without a chocolate pumpkin muffin if they have them!  To die for...""",w1bmiguF,2748

They do \Adult Swim\"" on Saturday's and Sunday's - you don't have to be a guest at the hotel to go. Everyone is welcome and you can bring your own booze~ It is a lot better than other places (say the Mondrian) as the people are chill and you don't have to be a supermodel or look like one to go there.

This location is one of the best I've been to, as the food is awesomely fresh and hot and the wait is small.  It also has a lot of seating, both inside and out, but the backs are wicked uncomfortable in the benches.  The rest of the \""ambiance\"" is pretty normal and not exciting. \n\nThe sizes are huge, from burrito to salads.  The chicken is moist and flavorful, the steak is good and not overcooked, and you have different options for beans (even though I dont eat them).  I love their white lime-cilantro rice, the sour creme is not bitter, they have a great pico, and I have a love of the cheese they have.  My favorite things here are the burritos and taco bowls - with LOTS of guac - with chips and guac on the side, topped with their yummy house lime-salt.

He also had the ceviche.  The ceviche was way too bland like the pate.  Maybe they are being careful on the spices.

There was often some air of pretension, but what's a person to do at that price point?\n\nFirst, the drinks. We spent a moment at the bar and found the cocktail program had recently been taken over by a new bartender. We tried a few of the classics from the menu and they were fine. Then, we tried a few of the drinks she was \giving a shot\"" for the new menu. They were excellent. Go sit at the bar and drink - drink your socks off! The great shame is that when you're at the resort alone you cannot go eat at their bar - which remains empty at the low season.\n\nThe menu is immediately odd to read and it takes a little guidance from your service staff to understand. Once you've gotten your bearings on the sizing, courses, tasting menu options... there are a lot of great options. I enjoyed this as I often find that restaurants of this type offer a restrictive menu that boarders on, \""we know what's best.\"" \n\nWe wandered through several courses that were each splendid. The spices were a great blend of classic flavorings and local inspiration. The veggies, seafood and game were all exceptionally fresh and well prepared. The service was prompt and informed. \n\nThe wine list here was very nice and accessible. Some familiar bottles and a few more interesting selections. I do, however, warn you that the decanter is a piece of theater. It looks like the murder weapon in a futuristic space drama - and I was afraid of it. :) \n\nWhen in Phoenix you should go to Kai. Keep your group small and it won't disappoint. I would advise calling ahead, as the kitchen will not sit more guests than they are staffed for.

640,2018-03-25 21:21:22,"In a nutshell, this place is awesome.  Frigging awesome.\n\nSince I work close to here, I typically have a lot of the same crappy ass options for lunch that I get sick of.  Original Hoagie challenges these crappy options and comes out the victorious winner, like Tom Berringer in the Movie \Sniper\"", when he knows he just owned his enemy.  I would come to this place more than once a week if I made more money than I do.  It is just one of those places.  \n\nI will give this place my official N.F.A. rating (no fucking around)\n\nHere is my typical experience when I come here.  Now, I have tried about 5-7 things off the menu here in my 100 visits or so and they are all awesome.  Fresh ingredients, lettuce doesn't taste like water, meat doesn't taste like Carl Budding, soft bread (god the bread here...damn...) and kick ass service.  My \""regular\"" item takes a few minutes longer than the typical sub.  The owner sees me in line, has them start making it before I even order it so I don't have to wait as long. \n\nA-fucking plus.    \n\nLet's talk about the owner, shall we (I assume, might be the manager, not sure but he is always running the cash register)  This guy is awesome.  And I hate people.  He always asks how my days is going, making small talk, etc.  If I haven't been in for a while, he says things like \""been a while since I have seen you!\"" \""how have you been?\"" \""Come back more often!\""  He is the guy taking orders every time I have been there.  Since I am not a huge fan of soda, he always gives me a good size ice water and doesn't bitch about it or charge me for a cup.  That charging for a cup thing is horse shit and non-existent at this place.\n\nBy the way, no fee for using a debit/credit card either.  I almost always use cash, but a plus for you card users.\n\nThe restaurant is always clean.  Tables are free of garbage and left over food.  They always have the daily newspaper to read and I have never been pushed out of there if I read it after my meal is over.  The place doesn't smell of burned bread or rotten meat either, like a lot of other sandwich shops.\n\nIf I had to make a complaint it would be that there is no bathroom here for customers.  The place is small and probably lacks the resources for it.  Plus I bet it would piss off the health department if they knew customers were walking through the food prep area to wash their hands which is why it doesn't happen.  Know this before going there and piss/shit and wash your hands beforehand and the bullet has been dodged.  If these instructions are too hard for you, then I assume natural selection will eventually pay you a visit anyway.  I look for any way to cut down a business and with this place I really can't find one.  Can't ding a star for their shitter (or lack of) \n\nIf you are in the area and want a good meal, decent price (about 1-2 bucks more than the crappy national chains but after you eat you know where that money went) and good quick service, than give this place a try.  I found it by accident a few years ago and it was one of the best fuck up's I have had from a food point of view.  \n\nYou are clear to engage the Original Hoagie Shop.

Both were good.  I had chicken parm and I actually prefer a thinner chicken breast( butterflied).  The breading was soggy, not that light and crispy like I prefer.  The red sauce was just ok.  My uncle makes amazing red sauce that has a great depth of flavor.  This sauce was a little \""tinny\"" and lacking for me.  My tummy didnt like it either, I was burping it up all night.   My partner had baked ziti and I actually hated this.  Trying a bite of hers, made me crave my baked ziti.  This baked ziti had a huge lump of ricotta on top( not mixed in).  To me, that is not proper baked ziti.  The pasta wasnt sauced enough either.  \n\nMy aunt had eggplant.  cant comment on that since I despise eggplant.  She loved it though.  My uncle had a pasta dish that had brocolli rabe and gemelli pasta.  They subbed out chicken for the sausage so my uncle was happy.  The bread was so/so.  The salad was basic.  The dressing wasnt emulsified ( pool of oil on the bottom of the plate). My homemade flourless choc. cake was the best thing about the meal.  The owner was very nice, but I was just not that impressed with this food.  I've had way better Italian food in S. Florida.  Cheaper too.""",HOSGnryF,4668

Little did I know, Notorious P.I.G. would definitely live up to its name. Never again.\n\nMy boyfriend, daughter and I were excited to discover a BBQ joint near our house. My daughter got the sliders and mashed potatoes with gravy. The sliders (from the kid's menu) were inedible. I almost got annoyed at my daughter for being too picky...until I took a taste for myself. The brisket slider tasted horrible; it was like chewing on burnt rubber. The pork slider was way too spicy for a child. The mashed potatoes were watery.\n\nI ordered the pulled pork with a side of mashed and Texas Toast. Okay, so first of all, if I'm going to a restaurant, I expect the Texas Toast to taste better than those from the frozen food section in the supermarket. Uh, yeah...no. The \""Texas Toast\"" from this restaurant is just regular toasted white bread with no taste. I had to put butter on it just so it would taste like something. The pulled pork was the most bland bbq pork I have ever had in my life. I left half of it on the plate, even in my hungry state. Very disappointing,\n\nOne thing that was good was the cookie sundae. They made the cookie fresh. We all shared it and thought it was great.

The latter was enjoyed by my friends. They mentioned that it was 'pretty good.' I had a sandwich was a reasonably sized and tasty. The wines they had were also flavorful. However I've gotta say that the drinks are pricey! \nGood atmosphere for a warm night but too $$$. I'd like to check it out again during their Monday and Tuesday specials for the $20 deal.

654,2018-05-13 12:19:03,"I'll preface this review by saying that I've never been a fan of hospitals. My experience with hospitals growing up was always to visit friends or relatives that were sick or recovering from accidents, and I've never felt 100% comfortable at the site of blood, dealing with disease, or \scary\"" situations.  For these reasons, I really respect doctors, nurses, and all of the staff that work at hospitals to help those in need on a daily basis.\n\nAll of that being said, I've seen my fair share of emergency rooms in the last few years, and for the most part, I've had decent experiences, even as the patient.  I've actually been to this Scottsdale Healthcare location three times already in the past eight months: twice for scares with the pregnancy and once for a breastfeeding class.  This is the hospital where my OB/GYN delivers, so naturally, this is where I'll be heading when Baby Mess is ready to enter the world... and I'm confident that I'll be in good hands when the time comes!\n\nI've heard great things about the facility itself, especially the labor/delivery area, from other friends that have delivered here.  And from my experience to date, the staff has always been great as well.  Parking can be tricky, but they do offer complimentary parking during the week... and the breastfeeding class I took was very informative.\n\nBottom line: I don't think any hospital will ever be at the top of my list of \""fun places to hang-out,\"" but if you or someone you know is in a situation where medical help / a hospital is needed, you can't go wrong with Scottsdale Healthcare.  Fingers crossed, I'll still feel this same way after I deliver this baby!""",WqCPOW5B,1185

660,2018-01-06 22:56:29,"THIS PLACE IS AWFUL!!! I wish I could give it no stars. I had a terrible experience here and wrote my previous review earlier this week. Their PR person contacted me and asked more about it, so I told them. They asked if they could pass my information along to the Director of Operations/Owner and I received a two page letter degrading me and basically telling me that I am a self-righteous b*tch who knows nothing about customer service and I only care about myself. \n\nTodd Goldman, the owner who so kindly took \the time to teach young girls like [me] life lessons\"" about customer service and the restaurant industry and point out that I \""get so mad and take it so personally that [I] fail to think rationally while [I] struggle with the idea that [I am] not the most important person in the world\"". Apparently my \""myopic viewpoint and exaggerated opinion of [myself] are staggering\"". Whatever he may feel about me, I do know one thing about him: I will never step foot in one of his establishments ever again. This does not seem to bother Mr. Goldman because, as he told me in his letter from this evening, according to him, \""[I] feel that [I] am so influential in this community that [my] posting will dissuade people from visiting [their] establishments\"". I only wish I could attach the PDF letter that was sent to me that includes all of these lovely morsels of insight and opinion so you all could have the pleasure of reading it. \n\nI cannot imagine ever sending something of this magnitude to an upset customer, and yes, I do hope that people read this and see that they should pick Fox Sports Grill, Half Moon, Blue 32, Firehouse Bar and Grill, Duke's, American Junkie or any of the 1000 other sports bars in Scottsdale/Phoenix to enjoy their bar food, beer and sports viewing. It is unbelievable behavior coming from a business owner and Mr. Goldman should be ashamed of himself.\n\n\n\n***ADDITION 10/19/2010***\nI was currently in the building with 11 guests, sitting at a 6 person table when I asked to be accommodated.

661,2018-03-27 15:49:41,"This place is like a blank canvas for you to paint your evening on. You really get out of it what you put into it. In and of itself, this place is just an average bar. It's kinda neat and it kinda has a theme and the layout is kinda good enough for you to kinda be able to wander around looking for your friends, a hookup or a fight. \n\nA few facts: \nI've been here several times, and it's never been apeshit busy. \nI never had to wait in line to get in. \nIf there is ever a line here, I just keep on moving. \nI typically find a decent place to sit. \nI've never met anyone here that I would want to continue to know beyond that. \nI've always come here with a group of people, and it was never my idea to go.\n\nI tend not to drink when I come here, but I think about the only thing I've had here is an Appletini years ago - also the only place I've ever had one of those. They put a little thin apple slice on top and I thought that was the coolest thing. I found out later just how not special that was - and that I was about one Appletini away from getting a boyfriend and matching fanny packs. So funny the idea that a drink can \make you gay\"" - like it's a magic potion or witches brew or something. Honestly, I don't know anyone who drinks those anymore - gay or straight. As a rule, I don't drink any martinis anymore - I just detest the shape of the namesake glasses they come in.\n\nBut I digress... I've had some decent times here, but still these days I'll go out of my way to not go here. The only compelling reason to come here would be me and the company I bring - and I'd rather take my friends somewhere cooler. Devil's is a bit of a meet market and the atmosphere does lend itself to scamming, so if that's what you're looking for...\n\nI do hear about fights happening here quite a bit - a good friend of mine got blitzed here one night and almost got into a fight with another patron - took his shirt off, threw his arms out and bobbed his head even - he ended up punching a cop instead and wound up going to prison. Good times.""",0qZud31p,3099
662,2018-04-04 05:33:26,"La Hacienda looks beautiful inside.  It's dimly lit and full of cushy dining room chairs and big, clean tables.  It's very inviting and with Spanish fare on the menu, the aromas are mouth-watering.  My party included gentlemen who were acquainted with the chef, so we were sent a complimentary serving of every appetizer on the menu!  The table-side (i.e. prepared table-side) guacamole and fresh tortilla chips = outstanding!  Definitely order them if you're in the mood for an appetizer.  There's enough to share among a group of four or so.  We ordered seconds, but there were eight in our party.  Yes, the guacamole does contain onions, but the delicious avocado and other ingredients are so tasty that the onions did not even bother me!  Queso fundido is another appetizer that was popular at our table.  It's a dish that's probably six inches long by three inches wide and 1.5 inches deep filled with a mix of cheeses.  It's served with warm tortillas.  The cheese got cold kind of fast, but that's to be expected.  We had a delightful Pinot Grigio from Argentina with our meal, if you like white wine.  Mmm!  For my main course, I ordered the \Atun\"" which is tuna.  The server asked how I'd like it prepared, and I selected \""rare,\"" which was very delicious.  It was a small portion served over mashed potatoes.  My boyfriend ordered the Camarones Enchiladas, which is shrimp enchiladas.  I tasted a shrimp and it was darn good!  The feedback I received from the other diners at our table was all positive.  So why the 3 stars??  The service.  The servers waited until our appetizers were finished before even taking our entree orders.  Not cool!  We didn't get to eat our main course until two hours after arriving at the restaurant.  Also, we were a big party drinking several bottles of wine.  Sadly we had to flag down a server each time we needed a new bottle.  For this class of hotel and subsequently a fine dining restaurant of the same class, I expect excellent service.  I instead received mediocre service.  Hopefully this was just a fluke.  I'll let you know when I make it back to La Hacienda.""",gTAyjblz,2058

The ingredients used tasted fresh and prepared in a somewhat artsy fashion. \n\nIf you're in the neighborhood and looking for style Mexican,HVFh6ri9,4026

They have the cutest bags and shoes and I wish I would afford to shop here all the time.  They have an amazing selection of candles and jewelry.  They have such a cut baby section...when I have another child I would want to shop here.  It is so cool that they have some local designers as well as TOMS and other known designers.,zA4l2dC7,3347

705,2018-03-04 06:08:33,"This is one of my favorite events in Phoenix - I can't believe that I didn't review it last year!! \n\nCupcakes. Cupcakes. Cupcakes. I love it!!! There are a few dozen bakeries/restaurants here each with multiple cupcake flavors. Since its easy to overdose, even on the mini cupcakes, my partner and I usually split 1 mini between the 2 of us, that way we can try many without going in to a diabetic shock.  \n\nI always appreciate the \weird\"" flavors - this year, I have to give a special shout out to Urban Cookies for their tomato soup/grilled cheese cupcake and Barb's for their chocolate chipotle cupcake.  \n\nThis year, the event organizers attempted a \""tasting ticket\"" system where you were supposed to only get 6 or 7 samples...to everyone's fortune, very few bakers followed this rule and were handing out samples left and right to their adoring fans.  Thank you, bakers!! \n\nThere are also really cute t-shirts, cupcake eating contests, amazing raffle prizes, free photos, coupons galore, cocktails and more cupcakes. \n\nI love the location this event is at - The Valley Ho Hotel - although a slightly larger space would be nice. \n\nAlright, I'm off to the gym...""",4sZql8pI,1300
706,2018-01-29 05:19:41,"I am not a \cyclist,\"" I am just a bike rider.\n\nI became obsessed with Electra Townies after riding one.  I am a nerdy, middle-aged mom who just wanted a fun bike to ride with my kid.  I don't know from mountain bikes or road bikes.  After calling all over town and looking on the internet, a friend told me about Slippery Pig and how nice and helpful they were.  I called and they had my dream bike in stock, and at more than $100 less than I'd been able to find on the 'net.\n\nWhen I went in to see the bike, the little store was packed with hard-core cycling enthusiasts, talking about races and the virtues of various bike parts I had never heard of.  The lone guy running the store was courteous and took his time with each customer.\n\nDid I mention I know nothing about bikes?  Sometimes I hate going into specialty shops because the \""experts\"" there are just socially maladjusted snobs with their little corner of knowledge, and they lord that over you to assert their superiority.  I was a little nervous, because the Pig was definitely a \""real\"" bike shop.  But when it was my turn for assistance, my man Eli was nothing but nice.  Maybe the nicest guy ever.\n\nEven though it was past closing, he took his time going over the bike, gave me a beverage, offered me a discount, told me about the three free tune-ups I get for the next year, and gave me 20% off all accessories (because you know you have to trick out the new bike).\n\nWhen I went back a week later to get my basket attached, again at closing time, he remembered my name and seemed genuinely interested in what I thought of my bike.  George attached my basket, and I agree with the previous reviewer: he's great, too.\n\nI went in again last night to get a flat fixed, and this latest experience prompted me to write this review.  Again, I rolled in minutes to closing, and they fixed my flat right away, staying until well after closing.  But while I waited, Eli offered me my choice of delicious microbrews (!) and I sipped a lovely Four Peaks Kiltlifter Scottish Ale while they fixed my flat and attached a new saddle!  Where does that happen anymore?\n\nFor context, I had taken my daughter's bike in to another LBS a year ago, and they took two days to fix the flat.  They were also nice guys, but two days to fix a flat?  (And no beer.  I think I am going to make free beer a prerequisite for service providers from now on.)\n\nThese guys are just the best, and reminded me why it is almost always worth it to seek out small, independent businesses.  Thanks, Slippery Pig!""",IDI7z2v7,2693

714,2018-01-12 11:00:07,"I'm somewhat new to Arizona, so when relatives from out of town said they had heard of this place on the Food Network and knew what they needed to do to get in, I figured why not?\n\nWe get off work and head over to meet them at 5:00, when the place opens. There is a small valet lot (full) and a public parking garage ($12.00) which the restaurant will validate (only $9.00, though, you still have to cough up $3.00). Our dinner companions already had a table inside which was great because there was a huge crowd outside. Inside, the restaurant is teeny-tiny, with maybe six tables that seat four or more, a few tables that seat two, and a bar area where people can eat. The bathrooms are one-at-a-time only and the ladies' toilet did not flush properly. \n\nI scanned the menu and quickly realized that they serve pizza and some salads - that's it. So if you have any dietary restrictions you're pretty much f*cked. While we are waiting for our food to arrive my dining companions inform me that they showed up at 3:00 to secure a table. THREE?!??! and they WEREN'T the first in line either! WHAT? \n\nBread comes and it is homemade and delicious, with a crispy-outside, spongy-inside thing going on, and the inside was the best - soft and delicious with huge swiss-cheese-like bubbles (don't know how else to so eloquently put it). Then drink refills come. No one else is being served (so they fire up these orders TO order, not bad, okay). I didn't have salad but they looked pretty good - buffalo mozarella and fresh basil, huge slices of tomato for the caprese. Kalamatas on the baby greens salad. \n\nPizza comes out, finally! $12 each for personal-sized pizzas with thin crust. The four-cheese was great; you can really taste the separate flavors of the cheeses. Arugula on top. A couple of the pizzas had salami or sausage on them. Too salty (and I LOVE salt so yeah, that's saying a lot if even I am critical on that point). One pizza's crust was not burned but charred black on half of it. But it's food so it can't be perfect every time now can it. \n\nA table of two finished/paid/left. They were the first people to finish from the first wave of customers and it was after 6:00 pm when this happened, and there was still a shitload of people outside. Meaning that if you don't line up at 3:00 to get in at 5:00, the soonest you can be seated is after 6:00 (and that's likely if you showed up between 3:30 and 4:00 for a table). \n\nHere's where it gets tricky - we paid, but were finishing our drinks. We were NOT the only ones there taking up a first-wave table who hadn't left yet. And after paying $150 for PIZZA (give me a break, please) the hostess came over and asked us to clear out because \people waiting outside are getting upset.\"" Hey, I can see how that sucks for them but we're customers too and so is everyone else around us who have been lounging around for this long. When we exited the restaurant the people waiting outside were giving us (and everyone else who was leaving) DIRTY looks. Bitch please - it was YOUR decision to come here and wait in this ridiculous line, for one. For two - the food isn't that great anyway. Would I ever come here again? Hell no would I ever wait in a line that long for ANYTHING, not even if they sprinkled diamonds on the overly-salty meats. Oh, and I woke up twice in the middle of the night feeling like my face was caving in on itself and had to get up to go drink water.""",ZRxeZIAV,4668

I cannot say what exactly qualifies as a real taco, but there are subtle differences from a real taco & the kind you find at most Americanized/Taco Bell type places. First of all, you know you're at a real taco place when you walk in & the place is full of landscapers having lunch.  Next, the tortillas were small and doubled-up.  Then the selection of meats was really authentic: buche (beef neck meat), cabeza (beef cheeks), lengua (beef tongue), al pastor (marinated pork), carnitas (braised pork),and  finally the carne asada was actually flame cooked, not cooked on a flat grill.  The tacos are then topped with cilantro & onions.\n\nI tried one of each kind of taco and they were all greasy and full of flavor.  This was my first time there.  I plan to go back and try the tortas and maybe even the burritos because those looked really tasty.\n\nOh, the icing on the cake was the price... $1.25/taco.

747,2018-05-29 15:52:05,"Giving this theater 4 stars because my first and only experience here was a good one, although a couple things can be improved upon.\n\nFirst, I went last night with a friend to see \In the Next Room, the Vibrator Play.\"" As you may know or can tell, very adult oriented play. The majority of the laughs were in the first half of the play, but as a whole very amusing, entertaining, great performances and solid writing. It made for a fun start to our Saturday night.\n\nLike most theaters, symphony halls, performance centers, etc., they serve coffee, beer, wine and a few select liquors, which must be consumed before entering the actual theater. Likewise, I love the fact that one can purchase drinks (wine for us) for the intermission and the drinks will be poured and waiting for you without standing in line again. Bonus, considering the intermission may be your only opportunity for a restroom break.\n\nThe chairs are very comfortable within the theater and there really is not a bad seat in the house, considering it is a very small theater. I have two complaints, though, which are totally fixable in which case I would easily rank this theater 5 stars...\n\n1) The temperature was very pleasant outside, between say 60 and 65 degrees. Inside, however, we were sweating. It wasn't a dripping sweat but if you choose to \""dress up\"" to go to the theater, you might be uncomfortable, as we were.\n\n2) My second complaint is about the website and the frustration in navigating around to find seating charts that don't suck. Right now it's a crappy, what they consider, 3D seating chart that when clicked on will show you the available seats. The problem is, it doesn't work very well. It's just not clear. It's sad when you google seating charts for the theater and ticket brokers have a better seating diagram than the theater itself. So do yourself a favor and do what I did, find a good seating chart and call the box office. It's quicker and you know exactly what you're getting.\n\nMy thoughts on the best seats....the floor seats seem to be good and close. But I chose mezzanine  because I like the looking-down view. If you do choose one of the balconies, I recommend in front of the stage and the 1st row. If you sit on either side of the stage, you'll inevitably end up leaning forward in your seat and resting your elbows on the ledge in front of you to get the best view, doesn't seem that comfy. And I say front row because we sat center stage on the second row and my friend had a hard time seeing over or around the big hair in front of her. Just saying.\n\nGreat experience overall. Small venue, has a laid back feel to it with some folks choosing to dress to the 9's while others were comfortably wearing jeans. I'll be keeping my eye out for other plays that might interest me, as I will certainly return to this theater.""",4S7w77Ii,59

The whole buffet. And no refills on the sodas, either. Some greasy chinese crispy noodles. No soup.

The coolest thing they do is sell \once-worn\"" running shoes at a serious discount. The shoes are worn running by the staff so they can review them and then the shoes are put out for sale.

Their beer sampler is definitely a good way to get started. It's served in a row of glasses slightly larger than shot glasses.

All of their beers are certainly quality and quite enjoyable, though there didn't seem to be a huge \wow\"" factor with any of them. In no way will I hold that against them though, as none of the local AZ brews (that I've tried) seem to be doing anything very far outside of the box.\n\nNot only should you visit Sun Up to check out their craft, you should definitely go to try their eats.

Sure, there are a few things I would change if I could, but I cannot give this place less than five stars. \n\nRight when you walk into the Saguaro, the colors and design work will blow you away. I checked in on Saturday and got here way earlier than the normal check-in time, but when I got to the front desk I was pleasantly surprised to hear that it wasn't a problem! The girl working at the desk was so nice and asked me to wait about ten minutes and she'd have a room for me. She followed through on her word, and a few minutes later I had a bottle of water in hand from the valet guys and was making my way to my room. Since I was recovering from a cold and had a long morning of travel, I was so happy to be so close to a bed.\n\nI was totally blown away by my room. It's absolutely huge and beautiful, and the bright colors & cool designs pop. The king size bed is one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in, and the balcony is nice when I want to get a bit of fresh air. The bathroom leaves a bit to be desired, but you can't have it all I suppose. The robes are unbelievably comfortable, and the true comfort of this room is so appreciated. Also, there's a Kuerig in here with a variety of K-Cups. Yes please.\n\nThe room service menu from Distrito is ridiculous. When I got here, I ordered guac, chicken tacos, and a plantain app, and everything was so flavorful and well-made. The breakfast is pretty good, too. Employees are more than friendly and do what they can to make you happy & comfortable.\n\nI have only two small complaints... well, more just things to be aware of. The hotel was having some sort of pool party on Saturday from 12-6, and it sounded like an episode of Jersey Shore was being filmed right. outside. my window. The music was so loud I could feel the bass vibrating my bed, and had to listen to lots of \whoooooo!\"" and also some bro talk. I was so glad when that damn thing ended. This hotel markets itself as a social place, though, so you already know what you're getting yourself into. Also, on Saturday night around 9pm, two young men in staff shirts came by and knocked on my door to do some housekeeping. What? Why are you coming to my door on a Saturday night to fix up my room? I called the front desk to make sure that was normal (and yknow, they weren't some crazy dudes from next door) and the front desk assured me they were just being thorough. \n\nThe pool is pretty cool, though, and impressive. Think Vegas style. I don't know how appealing the furniture is because it's a little dirty and stained up, but I could see myself laying in the sun for a few hours at some point this week. The workout room is also a good size with tons of equipment!\n\nFive stars, especially for having a restaurant as cool and beautiful as Distrito attached. Glad to be living in luxury for the next four days!""",4MrmxgFY,3523

The decor of this place is my favorite they have so much beautiful art from local artists everywhere. I even love their slogan but alas \Comida Chingona\"" it is not. The first time I went I had the \""Enchiladas de Mole\"" but really 18$ for four small Enchiladas the second time I had  the Mango, Tomate & Camaron salad that was also ok but 14$ for 6 shrimp. We also ordered the \""Guacamole Casero\""  they make it at your table but it was poorly made and then they added dried cranberries I still don't know why they do that. One of my friends ordered the \""Cochinita Pibil\"" that was also just ok. I think the idea and decor are awesome but the food is just really not worth the price. I would be OK with paying good money for Great food but this is just not the place for that.  My table was full of people from Mexico City and Guadalajara Mex needless to say this did not fill the craving we had for fine Mexican dinning.

787,2018-05-28 11:29:30,"A note on my rating: Based on the expectations my friends created for this restaurant, I would give Cafe Zupas two stars. If I have to be entirely objective, I'd give it two and a half stars. Since Yelp doesn't offer half-star increments, I'm reluctantly giving Cafe Zupas three stars.\n\nWhy do so many of my friends love this place? I don't know. Could it be because many of them went to school in Utah, where Zupas originates, and the restaurant reminds them of their college glory days? If so, I get that. I, however, did not partake in their college experience so I'm not privy to the nostalgia they must feel when they are greeted by the harsh blue neon that is Cafe Zupas' decor.\n\nThe food, while good, is unimpressive. It's just risky enough to be different from your average cafe fare. With more locations popping up in Utah and Arizona (and \other states to follow soon,\"" according to their website), it's apparent that as a restaurant Zupas is more interested in growth (read: profit) than making an impact in the culinary world. In other words, it seems their focus is more on creating a menu that everyone will enjoy rather than true culinary innovation. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that as long as that's what their going for.\n\nI ate at Cafe Zupas last night for a friend's birthday dinner. I had a honey bacon club panini, which I enjoyed, although it was cold and somehow seemed grow soggier with every bite I took. The shrimp and sausage gumbo soup was alright; I found the shrimp disappointing. It was mealy and the size of shrimp you would find in a Cup of Noodles. For a dish that boasts shrimp as a primary ingredient you'd hope they'd do a bit better on the shrimp.""",8IdREBox,4460

Third place was Mozza in Los Angeles, Second was Di Fara's and the best in the country was Pizzeria Bianco. Coming from a renowned source making a \""best in the country\"" statement is pretty bold. Why Lombardi's in NY or Frank Pepe's in New Haven didn't finish top 3, I'll never know...\n\nSo I had a floating holiday that I took and decided to take the family to Phoenix, AZ. The main reason? To call out Bon Appetit on their bluff. Read up from many sources, like Yelp and Chowhound, and was told to get in line at least 1.5 hours before they open @ 5pm. You can read from the other reviews that they spent 3-4 hours waiting to get in. Plan ahead and you'll avoid their fates...\n\nGot there @ 3:15pm on a Friday with mags and a cold drink. Within 15 mins, two cars pulled into the parking lot and within 30 minutes, twenty people lined up behind me. Thank God I did not take the warning lightly and so we waited...\n\nFinally opened @ 5pm and not a second earlier. Got seated and we ordered the homemade mozzarella, tomatoes and basil appetizer. The real deal definitely tastes different than the factory produced ones: it had texture and character, but could use a splash of balsamic vinegar. Highly recommended. We then ordered the Margherita (ask for extra basil) and the Wiseguy. The Wiseguy was thick wood roasted onions, house smoked mozzarella and fennel sausage. While other tables took their leftovers home, we demolished dem two pizzas. The verdict: while it was the best pizza I had on the west coast, I must say it was not the best in the country, although it came very close. I am thankful that they are only 6 hours away from So Cal, so a weekend trip can be had at any time.\n\nHousekeeping notes: Make sure to start a wait list. There are going to be snakes that try to jump the line. Pizzeria Bianco doesn't start their list until 5pm, so that only applies to the second seating. Bring reading materials and cold drinks (as it was 100 outside).\n\nStay hungry, my friends...and good eatings!""",CdoSXECo,460

804,2018-01-10 15:28:35,I was spending a weekend in Phoenix and on a hunt for a nice NYE dinner.  I was a little disappointed that it was a Prix Fixe menu because I was so excited by what I'd seen on the menu.  No matter,9CL4Mtjk,1529
805,2018-02-24 23:44:08,"Think of a stereotypical restaurant in Scottsdale.  Sushi Brokers is that place.  Slightly unattractive waitresses flaunting their fake tits.  A superficial crowd, filled with oogling men and scary-skinny women with fake blonde hair.    \n\nWe walked in to Sushi Brokers, wanting a nice, quiet and satisfying dining experience.  I felt like I wasted an hour of my life after eating here. \n\nYou know the music is too loud when you feel the sub thumping throughout your body.  I usually don't mind louder music, but this was ridiculous.  This is no club.  It's a restaurant.  I almost asked, like a 75-year-old, for them to turn it the fuck down.\n\nOur waitress was clearly not interested in us, and was visibly disappointed when we didn't order alcohol.  Thanks, hun.\n\nMaybe the meal would redeem the place...but what ensued quickly shattered all hope of redemption.  NOTHING CAME OUT IN A TIMELY MANNER.  The food was SLOPPY, BLAND and STOMACH-TURNING.  \n\nMiso salad was meh--nothing memorable.  We requested steamed veggies and brown rice.  They do not serve brown rice, so don't even ask.  The veggies were overdone--no crispness whatsoever.  Onions were used as a filler between the three pieces of broccoli, mealy squash and overdone carrots. \n\nThe sushi.  As I write this i can already feel my unpleasant morning creeping up on me.  The tuna and yellowtail were warm and not the least bit fresh.  The veggie roll was bland, with a hint of something bitter.  Ew.\n\nThen we waited.  And waited.  And waited.  Didn't we order another roll?  \They have to cook the eel so it takes a while\"".  I've had Unagi before and it takes TWO MINUTES to cook.  \n\nAfter waiting 25 minutes we received our caterpillar roll and unagi.  The unagi was cold.  The roll was saturated in a gross version of eel sauce.  It was like honey.  The eel was gummy.  Avocado was not fresh, but somehow it was still green.  \n\nI made the unfortunate decision of using the restroom.  Absolutely disgusting, FILTHY.  And the music bumps up 10 decibels.\n\nThere is something so disturbingly artificial about every aspect of this place.  I will never return, even if they paid me.  A waste of calories and a HUGE waste of money.""",tqUbjZZD,4842
806,2018-01-07 00:34:15,"Every time I drove by Freddy's I wondered two things: I wondered if Freddy's was good and I wondered what the heck custard is. I know of General Custard, and I know of Colonel Mustard, but nothing of Freddy's Custard. That being said, as I drove by one beautiful spring Arizona night, I stopped in to see what I was missing. \n\nYou are better off going inside on your first visit since the drive-thru doesn't have a lot of item description and you will probably wonder what the heck you are ordering. Now, Freddy's boasts about it being the \Home of the Steakburger\"", so naturally I had to order one. I also ordered a \""Concrete\"", which is essentially a Dairy Queen Blizzard....except with custard. I asked what custard was and the nice woman  explained it was like ice cream but with egg yolk and more butter. I think she could have just said, \""It's like ice cream, but worse for you!\"" With the burger came fries, and then I threw in a hot dog for good measure.\n\nThe Steakburger was unique in that the \""burger patty\"" was thinly sliced steak, and quite good. It was unlike any burger I have ever had, and definitely in a good way. The fries were very thin sliced as well. They were hot, fresh, and didn't make me feel like I was breaking my diet completely since every fry was thin. Unfortunately, I am not thin, nor did the fries help change that. On to the hot dog, which was superb, mainly due to the Texas-toast bun. Some people may like an original hot dog bun but I prefer the folded in half Texas-toast over the regular any day. \n\nFor dessert I ordered a vanilla concrete with peanut butter cups and chocolate chips. I put it in the freezer when I got home so I could recover from the food coma I was in from dinner. An hour later I opened the freezer and partook in what was a delicious custard delight. It is a bit different tasting from ice cream, but again it is different in a good way. I enjoyed it immensely as I believe most people would. \n\nI believe Freddy's Frozen Custard is a unique fast food experience that many of you will like and some of you will REALLLLLLLY like. Maybe their unique flavor isn't for everyone, but if you spent 4 minutes of your life reading a review this long on a fast food joint I hope you will spend 5 more minutes trying it out. \n\nOh yea, and for those of you wondering...it was Freddy's custard, not Colonel Mustard, that did it in the kitchen with delicious fast food.""",NOwVzcFd,3187

We went early, around 7:30 on the Saturday before Halloween. All of the waitresses were dressed in \costume.\"" There was Provocative Prostitute, Provocative Cat, and Provocative I'm not sure but I think also Prostitute. I'm no prude by any means but there should still be a reasonable level of professionalism in a bar/restaurant located in the 'burbs early in the evening. The service was extremely slow and our waitress was inattentive. I will say she was very nice but clearly not hired not for her service experience. There was also a table in the back of shrieking children who apparently belonged to one of the  gentlemen working behind the bar (possibly manager?) either that or the Provocative Geisha was letting a stranger discipline her children. The music was so loud my husband and I had to scream louder than those shrieking kids to communicate with each other. Eventually we just stopped trying to talk and played with our phones. Not exactly how I wanted to spend the evening with my Honey. I am giving it 2 stars because the food was really good. My hubby likes his wings super crispy and he got just that and man were they tasty! I had one of the tarts and, it too, was delicious. The second star is for the music. Although ridiculously loud, the live music duo playing in the corner was talented and we enjoyed listening to them. I was also pretty shocked and dismayed by their draft beer selection. It was pretty basic for a placed called Taps. I would have assumed an extensive craft beer menu but the reality was that it had a couple of San Tan varieties and several other beers that you can find just about anywhere. A couple other things to notate were that there were no salt and pepper shakers on the table, we didn't get silverware or napkins until after our food was brought to the table, and there was clearly no seating chart or defined sections for the servers because they were squabbling over who was going to take our table. The whole experience made me feel like I was on a taping of Restaurant Undercover.""",0SmZnS25,1319

It almost tasted like over-sweetened yams pureed.

If you sit at the end of the bar, you can definitely catch a view of the live game (if you're tall enough and don't mind squirming around to avoid the obstructions of the support beams and people that actually paid for their tables).  But regardless of whether you can see or not, you still get the roar of the crowd for every big play.\n\nGranted - the prices are a bit higher and the selection is much more limited than your average TGIFridays.  But they do have drink specials and I had chicken fingers and fries that weren't terrible.  An interesting note - the TVs inside Friday's have a significant delay from the live game (7-10 seconds) which was weird when watching the TV broadcast, hearing the crowd react to a play, waiting for it to happen on TV, then getting the reaction from the restaurant.\n\nAlso, a note on pricing for the reserved tables.  Between my wife and I, we spent $30 each on food and drinks at the bar (a single app and entree between us and 2 or 3 drinks each).  Considering that the \upper deck\"" tables are $30/ticket with a $30 food/beverage credit, I think that makes the most sense for a last-minute decision to go catch the game.  The \""dugout\"" booths, which are still inside the restaurant but closer to the stadium seats are $35/ticket with only $17.50 credit - to me that makes absolutely no sense.  I didn't get a chance to see the \""outside\"" (of the restaurant) \""front row\"" tables, but those are $55/ticket with a $27.50 credit.  Those might be cool to try out once, but not on a regular basis.""",E7XD90FC,2138

853,2018-03-13 07:07:00,"The first time I went to the Sail, Gentlemen Afterdark was playing a super-rare reunion show and they blew the roof off the place. Incredible band, if you don't know 'em you're missing out. First impressions: the Sail is intimate, but also roomy, with a decent amount of seating, friendly bar staff and great sound. It reminded me a lot of the old Wong's...only less scuzzy (and I know scuzzy was part of the old Wong's charm). The Sail has live music every night, with pretty much the best bands in town on a regular basis--a decent-sized indoor stage and a big outdoor stage. The Zen Lunatics rule Thursdays with \Rockaroke\""--a live-band karaoke that draws a great (and very diverse) crowd that frequently includes surprise appearances from a variety of well-known local musicians. It didn't take long to become a regular. Yeah, the Sail charges a cover (usually just a couple of bucks, which pays the bands and the excellent sound guy)--but the drinks are strong and cheap and they have a variety of good beers on tap. It's a small price to pay for good bands every day of the week. They go out of their way to support up-and-coming bands, longtime valley musicians and visual artists--and it's a fun place to just hang out. If you like the best live music and art Tempe has to offer, there's no better place to be. If you don't, I think that Toby Keith's place is open. Try the Krispy Fried Macaroni & Cheese.""",vFVcav5E,656

I was having \one of those days,\"" and when I arrived at Lisa G a few minutes before my friend, I plopped myself down at the bar and ordered myself a big glass of Zin. \n\nI'm what I consider an \""independent woman,\"" but for the most part, it would have been more common for me to wait outside for my friend before indulging in a glass. There was something about the ambiance of the restaurant that was very inviting. Another single woman was also at the bar enjoying a beverage, and there were only a few tables in use.  (It was about 7:30 PM on a Tuesday night)\n\nMy wine was amazing, but Allison and I were a bit baffled by the menu for dinner. At first we had no idea what to get. We ended up splitting the steak salad and the empanadas. The salad was very good, but the empanadas were cold inside. I'm not sure if they are supposed to be this way, but I was expecting warm veggies inside ... especially since one of the varietes was supposed to have cheese. \n\nWe also enjoyed the creme brulee - perhaps the best part of the meal. I hadn't had creme brulee in years, and this was great.\n\nWhat will keep me coming back to Lisa G is this: The wine was great. The seating outside was lovely. And, my friend and I were able to chit-chat to our hearts content. \n\nI do recognize that we were there on a Tuesday night, though.

Authentic German folks working there and frequenting there. Much chatter amongst regulars and workers.\n\nPicked up a full liter of Maggi W\u00fcrze seasoning (the imported European stuff, not the crap you find in American supermarkets) and some Salat Kr\u00f6nung. Took a quick gander at their homemade wurst selection which included, amongst many others, white bratwursts, but only the N\u00fcrnberger variety, not the Th\u00fcringer variety (I know, I'm awfully picky).

859,2018-05-06 13:24:45,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for 5 nights in late August. We got a killer last minute deal which is why I can say we enjoyed our stay. If we had paid regular price we would have been disappointed. The service is hit and miss. We had great service at the pool every day and at the golf course restaurant but based on what other reviewers have said about the staff I'm glad we didn't have any major issues that needed to be addressed. A huge complaint of mine would be that the restaurants, lobby bar and espresso bar seem to be on whatever schedule the staff decides that day despite the open/close times listed. I went down to the espresso bar every morning (around 8) and all but once it was already closed for the day. Same with the lobby bar. We would go every evening and only once was it open and we ended up leaving because we sat there for half an hour and the bartender still had not gotten to us. One day everything at the hotel was closed by 6 so we ended up having to take the boat to the casino and eat at the buffet. It was really shocking to us because it was summer and there were a lot of conferences going on so you would think everything would be super busy in the evenings. The other thing that should be noted is that EVERYTHING is soooo expensive. But that's typical with these kinds of resorts. And they don't comp things here. You will be charged for anything beyond just sleeping and the pool. Wi-Fi, using the gym, room telephones, etc.  And you will pay an arm and a leg eating at the restaurants. Again, this was not too bad for us as we got our room for cheap so paying so much for food kind of evened it out. We hardly ever saw hotel staff. It was like every day there were 5 people working the entire resort! The things I loved about staying here that made it all worth it are: The view is amazing! It's so beautiful spending the day lying at the pool with such spectacular surroundings. The food was actually really good. We had some expensive nice meals that were good and we had less expensive quickie stuff at the pool restaurant and golf course restaurant that was good as well (BBQ Chicken Pizza was so good). The rooms are nice. Again, I'm not sure they are as nice as they should be if you pay full price but for the deal we got we liked them. They are \cozy\"" and the bed is very comfortable. I didn't understand people complaining about having to walk so far to their room. It's a BIG resort and I thought the rooms all seemed close to the lobby (it's no different than being in Vegas and maybe having to walk through the casino to get to your room). It's nice that you can hop on the boat and get a ride down to the casino or just ride it and enjoy the scenery. We really didn't take advantage of the golf course or spa (food ended up taking up most of our budget) but we were fine with that. We stayed a Mon. - Fri. and most hotel guests were in conferences all day so we literally had the entire pool to ourselves most of the time. Every now and then a few others would come along but for the most part we felt like we were the only ones here and it was so quiet and peaceful. My one recommendation would be to get a rental car. We took a cab to the resort from the airport and we were OK for 2 days but then we started getting bored in the evenings. Besides, the casino there is nothing to do. We looked into the onsite car rental and OMG it was insanely expensive!! Like a 3 day car rental would have cost more than our entire trip!! So we called around to some local car rental companies and found a great deal and just took a cab to pick up the car. Overall, I would say this resort is good for older people who want peace and quiet and like to head to bed early or for families with young children. However, if you are paying full price it's just not worth it.""",6FjG4bT8,2200

The wings (we usually get the buffalo hot) are quite tasty as well.  Decent size, decent quality.  We order them \well done\"" or a little crispy b/c we prefer them that way.

905,2018-01-25 00:02:26,"Solid three and a half stars, rounded up because I am feeling magnanimous today . Others have already waxed rhapsodic about the high points of this little hidden gem: the decor (slightly kitschy, somewhat modern and a pinch of rustic), the salsa bar (over ten types, freshly made and flavorful without the tastebud massacre of straight hot chilis), and the horchata (yummy and light, made unique with the addition of finely chopped cantaloupe and strawberries and a sprinkle of pecans). \n\nBeing a quesadilla fanatic, I got the veggie one. Now, mind you, I had not read any reviews prior to my visit, so I was somewhat disconcerted  by the three pound Mexican calzone that arrived. I'm not complaining -- it was quite tasty -- but the puffy, doughy corn \tortilla\"" exterior was a bit much for me. Oh yeah, and the five handfuls of cheese inside of it. Too much. The damn thing was so big, it eventually became three meals.\n\nMy SO, the ultimate Mexican food snob, dug his chicken burro, although it was overstuffed and gooing and oozing everywhere, requiring him to attempt to consume it with a (cheap, flimsy plastic) knife and fork. Try cutting a hot, goopy mess wrapped in a tortilla sitting on a single thin piece of paper on a wicker basket with bendy cheap utensils. Yeah. Total mess. Not first-date friendly.\n\nThe location, parking, and service are questionable, as others have noted. We beat the rush by going late morning; I didn't think the wait for the food was unreasonable, but I wouldn't be stopping in here for a bite if I was in a hurry.  While I loved the horchata, the fruit was chopped just finely enough to go shooting up the straw unexpectedly. Total choking hazard for the less physically coordinated (read: me). \n\nOverall, pretty, pretty good. We'll be back, although I'll pass on the quesadilla next time...""",K5vYmKWj,701

909,2018-05-06 09:53:18,I thought I was done with Red Lobster when I got rid of my ex.  Mind you I don't hate the chain but I have never been really impressed.  However the birthday girl wanted their crab legs so off we went.\n\nArriving about 6:00 for an early dinner we were given a place in line which took a little over 30 minutes to get seated.  There is only so long a 5 year old can keep occupied with the lobsters in the tank.  If it had just been L and I we would have taken a seat at the high tops that were part of the bar even though she doesn't drink.   When were seated we were told it had been like this since about 3:30.  Starting just after we were seated it started getting quieter as fewer tables were occupied but we noticed as we left about 8:00 that with about a fourth of the tables empty there were still about 4 parties waiting to be seated.\n\nApparently one of the reasons they were slammed early was the all you can eat shrimp which two of us partook of.  The women chose to build their own feast and the kids got chicken fingers and linguine shrimp respectively.  To start with us adults got lobster stuffed mushrooms which were pretty good.  One of the supposedly good things about a chain in this price range is the predictability,5jCvP0TO,3387
910,2018-02-15 05:10:01,"Best sushi around!  I have visited a ton of sushi joints and until I stumbled upon this place I didn't know what a real sushi place was.  The chefs are very personable and I felt right at home.  Many times, I visit them for happy hour by myself however, I feel like family and the chefs actually remember me when I return and I keep coming back...   \n\nThe chefs are extremely creative and will make rolls on the fly.  I simply have to tell them what I am craving and they create something amazing based on what I want.  I have not experienced many sushi places that will customize everything.  I do not even ask for a menu anymore as they allow me to create my \own\"" menu.  \n\nThis is a family owned place.  No chains which I try avoid.  The family cares about the quality, service, and actually gets excited about their restaurant.  They want to please the customer and are always educating me on where they get their fish, what was just flown in and what they think I should try.  (Yep they remember what I had and like in the past.  That's what I call customer service!\n\nThe fish is incredibly fresh.  I was not a big sashimi fan until I started eating at Yume.  They have White Tuna that you cannot find at every sushi joint, as it is my understanding that the shelf life is only 12 hours.  They have a seared Albacore that is accompanied by a very light mustard sauce that is a perfect pair.  One of my favorite roll is the TNT, which has these warm huge bay scallops on top without the globs of mayo so many places use to bake their sushi toppings.  The other is the Naughty Girl that was created for me, as I wanted a \""fried element\"" in my roll.  They took chopped fresh Ahi Tuna that was finely chopped, rolled them into balls, lightly batter and fried them, cut them in half and toped them on a roll with jalapenos, asparagus, avocado and cucumber.  You don't like jalapenos I am sure they will customize it just for you.  They also have sushi for the non-fish lovers that include a killer grilled ribeye roll.  Now I can get my boyfriend to visit there, as he is not a big fan of what he calls \""bait\"".  \n\nThe prices are amazing.  They have a variety of sushi during lunch and happy hour that are 5 dollars and they actually consist of raw fish not just a cucumber.  \n\nThe ambience is just my style.  I am not looking for a meat market place that happens to serve sushi.  I want a place that I feel comfortable at with friends or by myself.  I am comfortable in my skin at Yume.  It is a great place for families also.  \n\nFinally yet importantly, they have a VIP club for customers (like me) who frequent Yume often.  I got an incredible loyalty coin that is beautifully designed that allows me to get happy hour prices all day long.   What restaurant gives you happy hour prices all day?  \n\nBottom line is you have to try the place.  Its food, service and passion brings me back every time.""",OIwsFkjK,2768

We ordered two beef noodle dishes, but when the order came out, there was only 1. Isn't it a bit obvious that there are X amount of people and there is 1 less entree ordered? It took 3 different waiters/waitresses to get it fixed and by the time I got my bowl, my friends were already done eating.\n\nShaolin bao's are tasty, but they are a bit overpriced at 8 bao's for $8. We asked the server how many bao's per order, but he didnt know so another server came and said \8, but am not sure.\"" Shouldn't the server know these things? \n\nThey shouldn't be so stingy with the ice, our cups literally had like 3 cubes per cup, and when they refilled our water, there was no ice in it at all. When we sat down, when they poured our water, the waiter guy overfilled our cups resulting in water spilled on the floor and splashing onto my feet. It's just water, but still annoying. \n\nIn all, the food is pretty good, worth 4 stars. Their service was a 2.

928,2018-04-14 10:47:13,"Pretty embarrassing overall is how I would classify this place! \n\nHere is how it went down... Our friends were in town from Laguna Beach, they naturally wanted to do something that would allow them to experience the beautiful Arizona weather. Once we paid the $16 per person fee for the \Pick Three\"" deal, we stood aside assuming since we told the girl we wanted mini golf first she would assist us with getting our putters and balls and we would go about our day. WRONG! The girl behind the counter went to collecting money from the family of 12 (no exaggeration) that was waiting behind us. Can you believe they actually got all their putters and balls before we even got the consideration of a glance from the employee. \n\nOnce we received our supplies we made our way to the course. Now, I have played at this particular course before and will admit it was an OK time. But this particular time there was a bunch of dead plant material laying in the gutters of what I am sure must have been flowing streams that are now just nonoperational. This must have contributed to the awful stench that closely resembled raw sewage. \n\nBeing that it was hot out, we went back to the concession stand and got drinks and refreshments. The only positive thing I have to say about this experience was the fact that their concession prices were pretty fair. After our quick rest and drinks we were off to the bumper boats to use one of the remaining two activities of our \""Pick Three\"" deal. \n\nThere was no line so went went right up to the front. There was not an employee available to help so we waited around for a few minutes before someone finally showed up only to tell us that there were only two bumper boats that were operational. Being that there were five of us, of course, was not really an option. \n\nBy this point, I had decided I was going to make my disappointment know to person in charge. I stopped someone walking by and was directed to the park \""Manager\"" who looked to be about 17 or 18 years old soaking wet. I shared my frustration with him and was offered to add more tasks to my \""Pick Three\"" offering. That seemed pretty ridiculous considering nothing there was working anyway, so I didn't have to think twice when I declined his extremely generous offer. He then instructed me to visit the Fiddlesticks website and make a complaint to their corporate offices in hopes of getting new battery chargers for the bumper boats. Rest assured I will be contacting the corporate offices by email and sending them a link to this rave review! \n\nSo on to the next event, the go karts. We get in, I push the gas pedal just to be sure that it was working (I was a little gun shy at this point). The kart made a promising vroom vroom vroom and we all took off. After the initial lap was completed it was everyman for himself. Before I could blink an eye, my kart started spitting and sputtering so I pulled off into the \""pit\"" and got out and waited the remaining five or six laps for my friends to finish. \n\nOverflowing with frustration, we gathered our crew and left for the day. Each of us out $16 for what I would consider payment for a few hours of my life that I will never get back. \n\nStay away from Fiddlesticks and find something more worthwhile to spend your hard earned dollars on!""",1OX1sa5d,1917

There is also water in huge white stone natural catchment areas, hence the name \White Tanks\"" \nHowever, recently there is a library being developed at the edge of this park, far from many homes and just plain uninspiring to think that everyone who goes there has to drive a good few miles just to read a book\nHere are my thoughts on the matter that I wrote in this article about the new \""Green\"" library in AZcentral\nhttp://www.azcentral.com/community/westvalley/articles/2010/04/21/20100421-white-tank-mountain-regional-park-library.html\n\n\""I could not believe when I pulled up to the White Tanks to take a coveted hike through the beautiful hills, that the removal of huge cacti and the building of yet another public monstrosity was taking place. First of all how can anyone call this green? Can't we just leave one place in the valley free from so many cars, asphalt and brick? How is anyone supposed to get out there anyway? It is so far from most home development and completly in the wrong direction to support any kind of \""Green\"" living and combining activities as most people do when they visit a public institution such as finding a place to eat lunch, a store to check out, or to mail a letter. Putting a library out away far from urban development and removing tons of cacti to transplant somewhere else is a crime against nature! \""""",4IsXeEOX,1695

952,2018-01-08 21:04:25,"Not so impressed.  I've known this place existed, other veg's have recommended it. It was where I wandered off to after my first attempt to start my day in disaster.  \nCute atmosphere I felt I wandered into a homey kitchen.  But that was it; nothing more after that but disappointment.\n\nHere is my list of issues:\n\nAs a Sustainability student all the styrofoam sucked - homey kitchen and with 3 employees; nobody can think  the experience would be made uber chic with mix and match shabby chic thrift store found dinner ware?\n\nSustainability point #2... Localavore It Ladies! & than advertise it loudly & proudly.\n\nSustainability point #3... All the beverages in milk gallons, lined up like a fleet, in an ice bath on the counter was not so pretty either.  \n\nReally in a place so homespun breakfast ends?  I asked about the breakfast rolls -- sounded interesting but it was not allowed as it was 10:30 & breakfast ended at 10.  HOWEVER, moments later granny's \2 girls\"" flooded into the kitchen - other employees? - and granny offered them the left over soyrizo that was explained to me was an ingredient in the breakfast I could not have.  \n\nAfter looking in the window and seeing all the unhealthy mayo laden salads, my choice was  a veggie tamale - It did not kill me but it did not make me happy laying there like dog food that was just slid out of a can - sorry this was my first impression - lying in its sauce on the cheapest foam plate imaginable, not pretty.  This was just food to make a turd; not much more.  Actually it was brown like turd.  The description boasted tri color masa and veggies, were the veggies ground into the masa?  There was never any veggie filling, so I guess it was turd all digested together to give my digestive track a break?\n\nWhile granny was pouring my glass of lemonade I spied guacamole on the menu, guac makes me happy.. granny said, \""Oh no not today; it is the day before a long weekend-- if I made guac & there were no customers it would go to waste, but here are some avocados I can give you some slices.\""  SORRY GRANNY I'VE WORKED IN PLACES THAT DID TABLE-SIDE  GUACAMOLE .. don't limit yourself.\n\nLast on the list... those aforementioned younger ladies that seemed to dart in and out.. as a career waitress with my own grandmother, (that would have put a crack in my ass the other direction for doing anything perceived foul in the kitchen) I know better than to wear tank tops in the kitchen - exposed armpits not so kitchen-spectacular.  Another homey touch that would really add to the experience - vintage aprons - another great thrift store find!!!\nGood Luck Ladies.  Sometimes I can give a place the baseball test, 3 strikes before their out. Sorry, got to cut the losses directly here, won't be back.""",7UyWgvBC,4753

958,2018-02-17 01:02:02,"Yay - a FTR for Gabi K!\n\nLocated on Market Street at DC Ranch, Autostrada is the latest concept in Chef Aaron May's \collection\"" of unique restaurants in the Valley.  Autostrada, which means \""an expressway or highway in Italian\"" serves cuisine from all around Italy.  With a capacity of less than 50 inside and another 45 outside, it's small, but the design which includes glass, steel, wood and concrete, gives this hot new restaurant a sleek, industrial vibe inside which goes with the theme very well.\n\nI had the opportunity to attend a pre-opening dinner at Autostrada last night... I believe they will be open to the public in the next few days.  I cannot be tough on the restaurant, as it was their first night open, and I was extremely impressed nonetheless.\n\nWe waited a short while to get seated, but it was a pleasure since the bartender, Erica (aka Red for her red hair) was sweet, attentive, and knowledgeable about the history of the restaurant and the menu.  They don't have their complete wine / drink menu going just yet, but I learned the majority of the wines will come from Italy, and they will also be offering a wide range of cocktails.  We enjoyed a pinot noir and cabernet while we waited.\n\nOnce seated, Shanda took care of us... For our antipasti course, I went with the cauliflower soup and J chose the caprese tower.  In addition to these starters, we quickly made friends with the couple next to us, and the next thing I know, we're sharing their cheese plate - hey, nothing wrong with that, right?  \n\nNext up, I had a tiella casserole of grilled veggies including eggplant, zucchini, parmesan cheese and a zesty tomato sauce - it was delicious! And J's fettucini with scallops and mushrooms was pretty amazing as well.  We could've stopped here, but we kept going.\n\nFor the Segundi course, I chose the sea bass and J had the veal... this is where Autostrada has a few kinks to work out, but remember, it's their first night open... I didn't love the fish - wasn't a fan of the cold veggies on the plate or the sauce which came on the fish.  The veal however, was fantastic - and I'm not usually a veal fan!  It was served on polenta - yum!  Our new friends at the table next to us chose the steak and the halibut... and again - steak was a hit while the fish dish - not so much.\n\nWe finished with the dessert that Shanda recommended, the crepes with chocolate and strawberries... omg they were scrumptious.\n\nAs you can tell, we had a lot of food... and our bill proved it coming in at around $100 before tip.  But, we had a lot of fun, made some new friends, and found several other menu items to go back for next time we're in the DC Ranch hood... plus, Autostrada will be open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner seven days a week.  \n\nWith the casual environment, friendly attentive staff, and the magical management/ownership team behind Autostrada, I'm sure they will be a success.  Buon appetito!""",dnlSWHpB,4134

980,2018-06-09 07:28:28,"My fiance and I tried the place because of a Groupon.  We live in the same neighborhood and see the place all the time but the look of the place was never enough to draw us in.  There is nothing eye catching about the business front at all.  It's in a strip mall and looks old.  At night, they turn on strands of tacky Christmas lights that only attract attention to the fact that the lights are so poorly hung.\n\nWhen we arrived for dinner we were greeted by an empty corridor, no host station and no host.  We could see what looked to be a bar but it wasn't a bar that I'd want to eat, drink and socialize at.  To pass the time until we were finally greeted we browsed the many framed publications touting how incredible the place was.  I'm already here...I don't need any more persuasion.  It's time for the Chef/owner to take down the \look how good I was\"" trophy wall and go with a more inviting modern look.\n\nWe were greeted by friendly gentleman who seated us on the main lower floor.  He handed us our menus and asked if he could get us something to drink.  There is no drink menu on the menu.  No beer list, no soda list, no liquid period.  We asked to see the wine list, which had only bottle prices and doesn't even hint that they sell wine by the glass.  Once I asked if they had beer and sold wine by the glass it was like we made a breakthrough.   The menu seems a bit outdated so I  went with the Lasagna, the basics.  While we sat waiting for our meal, the salads came.  Weird...the menu didn't mention anything about a salad nor did the waiter.   More lack of information from the menu.\n\nNow on to the decor.  It is terribly outdated.  Tacky, bland, pale paint scheme, brass fixtures, mirrors and cliche wine bottles.  There were beautiful fresh flowers throughout which we really enjoyed.  I was unfortunately seated directly in front of two paintings both with a woman and a little girl drinking what appears to be wine.  I'm guessing they are personal family paintings but they are horribly out of place and bordering on creepy.  I couldn't take my eyes off of them and that distracted me throughout the night.  This place needs a makeover, new modern paint scheme and some updating on the artwork.\n\nThe lasagna came.  It was OK at best.  I tried my fiance's chicken genevese at it was horrible.  The chicken tasted like it was boiled which is an instant dish killer for me.  We did not take our leftovers.  We asked for the check and it came with a after dinner cordial which was a nice surprise and tasted delicious. \n\nWe won't be back.  To be honest Oregano's lasagna is better by far.""",8viZjQIR,3104

Growing up in Canada in an area with heavy Scottish, Irish and British immigrant population and pair that with the fact that my husband IS British and we make a nightmare of a couple to try to impress with a \pub\"".\n\nWe tried Rosie McCaffrey's out of sheer desperation for something to eat one night as neither of us could find anything in the fridge. As we pulled into the very busy parking lot around 730 we braced ourselves to be seriously disappointed. Heading inside we were relieved to see a warm, wood paneled dining area that was slightly separated from the bar area, this helped muffled the noise from the Happy Hour crowd that was still working on their final pints.\n\nA sweet friendly gal told us to grab a seat anywhere and she would be right back to take our drink orders. As we settled into a comfy wooden benched booth we both began to have a glimmer of hope. The draught menu contained Magners Cider which my hubby had not had since his last trip to England about 10 years ago and I settle on a bottle of local brew that was a mere $3.50! The drink specials were great and it wasn't even happy hour, and to top it off our waitress was prompt with the drinks, they were nicely chilled and she was about as sweet as pie.\n\nThe menu was another pleasant surprise, it is fairly small but with some strong dishes. If you like Boxty, they make it up fresh everyday, and the stewed item is different everyday so please check with the server. We both ordered fish and chips and we were blown away. The server presented us with a large platter of fresh cut fries and one large fillet surrounded by crisp, golden, BEER batter. Yep real beer batter, they even tell you they use Harps in the batter. The fish inside was perfectly moist, and a nice thick cut. No thin fish, fried to fish leather here! The slaw served on the side was fresh, so fresh that the cabbage crunched, no wilted, mayo slather gunk at this joint! Most importantly the tartar sauce didn't taste like bottled, it was creamy with lots of pickle and the malt vinegar was already at tableside.\n\nFor desert we tried the bread pudding with whiskey sauce. Moist and studded with plump rasins, drizzled with thick rich sauce. Absolutely delish! As we were digging into dinner, a live band started their set. The noise level was carefully controlled so that the band didn't drown out the conversations in the bar.\n\nOverall we left stuffed and extremely happy.

Plus, I'm a bit of a traditionalist and don't like all the \Pinkberry-esque\"" places with green tea flavors and fresh fruit toppings.  I want my yogurt served straight up, and I want a lot of choices of yogurt.  Golden Spoon delivers in spades in this regard.\n\nThere are usually a dozen or so flavors to choose from.  The sugar content is very reasonable, and if you want just a little bit they have a kiddie size that is about $2 - very reasonable.  The portions are pretty big so don't order a larger size if you don't want it piled up.\n\nOne suggestion if you like to add toppings is to ask for a larger sized cup so that the toppings don't overflow out of the cup.\n\nMy favorite flavors are Peanut Butter Cup and Heath Bar - they go great together side-by-side""",a1JBNV4K,4443

999,2018-02-04 08:22:05,"It wasn't what I expected, but I'll be back. To explain: their website says they feature \craft beers on draft\"", talks about having incredible coffee service, an amazing wine selection.... Being a beer geek, I was looking forward to a really nice beer selection. Nope. I ended up having an Alaskan Amber - not exactly an exciting choice. Then they charged it as an \""import\"" - beer nerds, I can hear your collective groan. Apparently if a beer isn't Bud, Bud Light, Coors, etc, etc, it must be an import. Good lord.\n\nThe food was good. I had the grilled cheese sandwich, and liked it though again it wasn't as spectacular as I was expecting from reading the website. I was impressed that the side of fruit was tasty, sweet raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, and strawberries. Nice touch. Definitely a step above the usual slices of cantaloupe.\n\nThe service needs a LOT of work. The patios were full so we were seated inside, which was not even half full. My friend and I both ordered a beer.... and waited ten minutes. Finally we had to flag someone down and re-order our beer, which was then delivered quickly. We had community service, so we were never sure exactly who was really waiting on us, and we had to continually flag people down to get service. That's not acceptable at a place striving to be this upscale.\n\nIn short, I would consider this a high-end sports bar, not a \""gastrobar\"" as the table tents call it, and certainly not a place to go for craft beer as the website implied. The website is very misleading, but now that I've been there and have adjusted my expectations, I'll be back. It's a great place to hang out, the architecture is super-cool, and the patios look like a lot of fun, if I can manage to get seated in one. Though I'll probably just go for breakfast or lunch as those menus look really good - this won't be a drinking spot for me, as the beer selection is disappointing.""",TRI9zJRQ,1184

It was all so promising.\n\nSo following my normal habits, my friend and I sat at the sushi bar and asked the sushi chef to simply feed me what he would like, \omakase\"" style. He seemed happy enough about this... and made some fairly tasty rolls, albeit nothing extravagant and all pretty basic items from the menu. Given that I told him the only thing I wouldn't eat was octopus, I somewhat expected him to be a little more creative. Generally that is what's to be expected from omakase. But, this was my first time there, so it was excusable. He didn't know my taste.\n\nWe ended up having 4 rolls in all, and then when I was about ready to ask for some sashimi to finish up, he hands us some nigiri; 2 pieces each of salmon and ahi tuna. Okay, cool, that works just as well. This is his choice, after all. Unfortunately this is where the low rating comes from. I entrusted him to showcase his selection.... and this fish he gave me was not fresh. It was slimy. It had hardly any flavor at all; the predominant flavors came from the rice and the tiny dab of wasabi binding the fish to it. I had to wash both pieces of nigiri down with water and tea.\n\nTo me, the true measure of a sushi restaurant is in its sashimi and/or nigiri. And this is unfortunately where Sushi Eye fell flat on its face in my experience. Perhaps I've been spoiled at other restaurants, but I can't see myself returning here to try again.

There were high school kids all over the place with skate boards. The girl working the register was 16 and slow and didn't really know how to take an order. Even the kid making the pizzas behind the counter seemed like he was 17.  They were all wearing these black t-shirts with their logo on it as if it were a high school senior year shirt..

It was better than Rays. It was better than Gus. It was better Venezia.  The crust was crispy but not burnt. The sauce was tangy but not overpowering. The mozzarella tasted like real mozzarella in that it was slightly rubbery and had that great salt water aftertaste. In other words, it tasted like a genuine NY pie. I know the New Yorkers are not going to give it's full due out of pride but if you put this place in NY and removed the Jamba Juiece ambience, any New Yorker would be fooled. Anyway, that 1 slice was practically the size of an entire pizza.  The flavor was spot on.  We go to NYC a lot so we know what real \pie\"" tastes like and this place passed the litmus test.

This has been the situation with 2 guys who have worked on Fridays..Seriously when your sign says you open at noon please be open at noon.\n\n#2: They don't carry enough current issues. \n\n\nThe good points are that the staff is friendly but not persistent and they allow you to browse the comics.  I could never read comics like that at Atomic..,qWWqPDnH,1226

Then again, in my experience, anything you order here will make you very, very happy.  The Hong Kong style dishes are super authentic, and they hit their spicier items at the perfect spice & heat levels with the \heat\"" never superseding the flavors.  The Mongolian beef, for example, leaves a little tingle on your lips, but it never feels hot.  You will love the values here; if you order an entree for each of you, you will be going home with a second meal to savor all over again.  Plus, we usually are the only non-Chinese people there.

1047,2018-04-26 03:04:56,"We all know that Costco's good for all of our bulk-item needs; I come here for Maranatha Natural almond butter (made with only dry roasted almonds, no added salt or sugar), clothes detergents (biodegradable) and fabric softener liquids (not-so-biodegradable), deliciously sweet and juicy cantaloupe (three in a mesh case for $6), Starbucks-roasted Kirkland-brand coffee beans, and the occasional  big box of Quaker quick-cooking oats (not those microwaveable packets of oats that have had the health-promoting fiber stripped off so that they cook faster).  I'd say the most frequent item I buy here is the bottled water- I keep a few in the freezer and fridge for future trips (I know, I know... I've been told and I've read somewhere that it isn't the best thing to do, but when you live in the desert, it's kinda necessary, y'know?).  Those 36-roll bath tissues and 12-roll individually-wrapped paper towels I bought a few months ago are running low, so I'll be heading back there in about a month or two to replenish them...\n\nSo, yes, there are bulk goodies to be bought here, but did you know that, as of yesterday, I am a happy owner of two 2-lb containers of fresh red and juicy ORGANIC strawberries for $6 each??  Just ate three luscious (and huge!) berries with some whole-wheat pancakes I whipped up using organic eggs also purchased here.  Too bad Costco doesn't sell organic condensed milk (I bought mine from nearby Whole Foods)... Shoot, Costco doesn't sell ANY condensed milk- what's up with that?  With all of the milky and decadent desserts (think Tres Leches cakes and flans) our valley's restaurants offer up, you'd think Costco would sell them to their customers.  (I make \leche flan\"" using eggs, condensed milk, evaporated milk, and sugar.)  \n\nAnother item I am very happy to have purchased here is the Viva bottom-loading water cooler/dispenser.  No more warm-ups with push-ups and lunges just so that I can lift a bulky 5-gallon water jug to fill top-load coolers hoping I don't spill any on the carpet!  Once in awhile you'll hear the dispenser's pumping system hum, but it isn't annoying.  The cooler also is lighted, so it serves as a nightlight for when you get up in the middle of the night and need a replenishing sip or two.\n\nKudos for Costco stocking up on more and more organic foodstuffs and biodegradable cleaning solutions/solvents.  Wonder what I'll find on my next visit?\n\np.s.  I also would like to add that I am happy with the service I've received and purchased at the optometry department.  Dr. Burns is friendly and quick with the eye exam, even if the the secretaries' antiquated system of appointment-keeping (paper, pencil, and eraser!) leads you to believe otherwise.  I am very happy with the contacts (my grade increased slightly, I'm afraid) and the glasses I purchased here.  I am happy to find out that the frames I bought at the Costco in Chandler can be re-fitted with new lenses here for just the price of the lenses.  The older frames are much-lighter than the new ones I bought, still look new, and, quite frankly, more-flattering on me-- don't want to ditch those!""",PJNbn7ou,1960

The server we had was very insistent we all stay in our seats if we wanted separate checks, which is understandable. However, later in the meal we were co-mingling...it was a party, after all. Our server was visibly annoyed and he even said, \This is disastrous. I'm so mixed up right now.\"" I'm a server, and even if that's how he was feeling, he could have been a little more positive about the whole thing. We all spent a lot of money and tipped 20%, so it's only common sense that you would be cordial and nice to your guests. Besides that, he also just had an arrogant, if you will, attitude. I asked before ordering if the Bolognese was beef or pork. He replied, \""Bolognese is always a mixture of both,\"" and just stared at me when I cheerily replied with an \""Ok, thank you!\""\n\nThat being said, the other server (I think his asstistant), was great. She promptly refilled drinks and smiled. The food was great. We had the Rock Shrimp appetizer and Sea Salt Chips, which were very yummy and served with great sauces.

The tables are too close together because it seems like you're hearing too much of the conversation at the adjoining table in my opinion. The 3 pancakes were huge.

1072,2018-01-17 14:12:02,"This place seriously rocks.  It satisfies basic cravings for Chinese and Mexican, with a quick pass over Jamaica if you're in the mood.  While there really isn't any \service\"" per se (you walk up to the counter and fill out an order form) the folks behind the counter are very friendly and helpful.  The ordering system can even be a bit confusing for a regular, but they'll take your order verbally, which is nice.  There is a sample center for newbies where you can get a spoonful of eight of their offerings, which is also nice.\n\nThe menu is simple and complex at the same time.  There are about a dozen protein choices, which is simple enough.  I think there are some vegetarian things on the menu, but I'm not sure, being more of a carnivore.  There are also four choices of rice (fried plain, pork, chicken or jerk) and two choices of beans (black and refried).  Then there are the delivery choices:  rice bowl, burrito, quesadilla or plain.  You can do one item, or a combo of two, with rice and beans.  The number of possible combinations is difficult to calculate, especially for math-anxious me.\n\nThe food is very good, and is high quality.  It's not sublime, fine cuisine.  Its ingeniousness does not lie in the ingredients or their preparation, but rather in the strange and wonderful combinations that can be created.  The emerald chicken is memorable:  moist chicken breast with a lovely sauce made from ginger, green onions and salt.  I googled this, found a recipe online and made it at home but mine wasn't nearly as good.  Chinese BBQ pork is just what it should be: five spice-y and sweet.  I'm too much of a wuss to order the jerk chicken (I tried a sample and felt incinerated) but dining companions have raved about it as a rice bowl.  My son adores the carnitas in a burro with chicken fried rice and black beans.  Tonight, I took out a combo:  emerald chicken quesadilla, Chinese BBQ pork quesadilla, pork fried rice, black beans, and a snickerdoodle.  This will be dinner tonight with plenty left over for the dog.  Total bill was under $9.  And the snickerdoodles are GOOD!  They're the same taste as my great-grandmother's were, but they're WAY bigger (a good thing).\n\nAmbience?  There is none.  It's strictly Costco plastic buffet tables with folding chairs and a concrete floor.  But who cares?  If you're taking it out, you've got to create your own ambience, anyway.  If you're eating in, you'll be paying way too much attention to your food (and that of your companions and neighbors) to bother worrying.  I also think the name is just too cool.  I am a huge fan of the politically incorrect, and \""Takee Outee\"" rules!\n\nFinally, the location could not be worse - it's hidden in an obscure strip mall behind the Walgreen's on Chandler Boulevard and Dobson.  However, if you want to try it out, FIND it QUICKLY.  A posting on the door advised that Chino Bandito will be featured on Food TV's Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives on April 7.  When Matt's Big Breakfast was featured last month, the wait times there tripled, so it's likely you'll be fighting crowds by the end of next week.\n\n4/2/08 EDIT:  It turns out that my order from last night was wrong.  WAY wrong.  I called to let them know, and they told me to come in tomorrow and they'll redo the whole thing.  Score!!""",F6ph91SI,2109

I still prefer In N Out's burgers, but this was a similar preparation (very fresh, made on the spot) and it's not 20 miles away from my house, so I know where I'll be going. Their fries are fresh and twice cooked, so they literally blow In N Out's limp, useless fries out of the water. Be advised: one small order if fries is more than enough for two people, and the standard burger is a double decker (ask for the \little\"" burger if you want what is usually considered \""standard\""). The atmosphere, such as it is, is a lot like In N Out, utilitarian and clean. They have cute little touches like free peanuts and they stack their bags of raw potatoes and jugs of peanut oil in the middle of the restaurant, I suppose to show you how fresh their fries are. The cajun fries are not cajun nor particularly tasty, but their regular fries are awesome city. I love that they don't skimp on the toppings and they kinda compress the burger as they wrap it in the foil. It comes out like a delicious, multi-colored hockey puck. \n\nAs regards the price, I don't understand why people are going on about how expensive it is. Two burgers, two orders of fries and two bottled waters set us back fifteen bucks, and we couldn't eat it all. Seriously, haven't you complainers ever heard of Burger King?

Even though all tables were occupied, the place wasn't all that loud. No yelling at your date like at the new club.\n\nIt is kind a fine line to walk but in honesty it is a pet peeve of mine as to how frequent the server comes. Too often and I feel like I can't even carry a conversation because I'm always having to stop and say \yes everything is OK.\"" Too sparse and I end up getting aggravated and attempt to fall asleep at the table to get your attention. Our server was kind and wasn't overly in your face and even when she came by she would crack a joke or something - I'm not really sure how to describe it other than I felt like she was being constructive instead of fulfilling an obligation to meet some corporate quota on server table visits.\n\nFood. Alright, first off I'm an idiot. I brought my date to a pizza place when she was allergic to gluten. Great right? I just brought her to a place where she can't eat! I only tell you this because after the dust settled she decided that she could have some of it. So here you have it... someone that knows that they are going to get sick from eating the food... and they ate it anyways. And they liked it and said it was \""worth it\"" (or maybe she meant I was worth it? No, no, it was the pizza!). That's a pretty good testament of the food... RIGHT? I think so and I agree that the food was pretty good! We got the cheese sticks and a halved pizza (two different types) with two of the signatures.\n\nAnother thing with food that I always review is the reheatability. I know this is kind of weird, but it is disappointing to take some food home and when you reheat it tastes like garbage. Both the pizza and the sticks reheated well. So, bonus points there Boombozz.\n\nSo here's the final verdict. Cool place. Cool workers. Cool food. I'll be back. As for the date, unfortunately we didn't work out. Maybe if I hadn't taken her to a gluten party house things may have. :P""",ZT1vzYVy,1566

1089,2018-04-23 01:44:07,"Mellow is the wrong word to describe the vibe at this pizza joint.  WIth a name like Mellow Mushroom, I was expecting to walk into a hippie dive.  The kind of place where everything looks like it's from out of the seventies and dedicated to the herbal drugs that users inhale.  Instead, Mellow Mushroom has a hipster bar ambiance.  Instruments and other musical items decorate the walls giving it a modern jazz bar feel (only with flat screens playing sports hanging across the bar). \n\nWith an overabundance of pizza places in any town in the US, Mellow Mushroom stands out by specializing in uniqueness.  Their specialty pizzas all sound odd but tasty.  The beer menu is huge and the 45 on tape are dedicated to micro and specialty brews.  If you want your traditional domestics, bottle or can is all your going to get.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I split a caesar salad and a Thai Dye.  The caesar salad was prepared perfectly.  The dressing was mixed in well and not overly creamy.  The croutons were awesome.  They were made in the restaurant, not from out of a box.  Why don't more places do that?  The pizza was great.  The quality from the dough to the cheese to the topics was excellent and fresh.  The sweet curry sauce on pizza actually worked a lot better than I expected.\n\nThe service was also excellent.  Our server was really cool about explaining the drink and food menus.  He also pointed out a few things about the layout of the restaurant.  There also was another waitress who stopped by every now and then asking if we needed anything.  The teamwork was noted an appreciated.  Nice to to hear someone say \let me find your server.\"" \n\nMy only complaints are that we were originally seated under a vent, and it was freezing.  They had no trouble moving us, but wow, they may want to save a few bucks on their energy bill and turn down the a/c.  The prices are also a little higher than I wound want to pay for a pizza.  But they do make up for the price with quality.  Mellow Mushroom is definitely worth it if your looking for a change from pace from you're regular pizza place.""",E2UdEH3B,3735

1102,2018-02-25 02:38:44,I came to this restaurant after it was recommended to me from a big auto mechanic with a large belly.  Since I'm not from the area but I was pretty hungry I figured it was safe to trust someone who eats a lot.  From the outside it looks like a used car lot but once you get in and try the food you'll realize none of that matters.  My dad and I ordered a house salad to start- which was pretty good nice variety of greens and veggies.  For my entree I ordered the scampi a limone.  The white wine based sauce was was really well- balanced.  I thought it was delicious.  My dad had the chicken parm and  that was good also (I had a few bites).  For dessert we had the cheescake and the creme brulee.  I have to say I don't even like creme brulee but his was really tastey!

The soup was made really well.\n\nI had the chicken salad plate. The chicken salad was made with this really well developed dark meat chicken that was cooked so perfect it was a joy to eat. I think it had a little mustard and oil holding it together and it had tiny pieces of green apple and pecans though it making it tasty and delicious. I really enjoyed the vegetable salad on my plate.

1119,2018-03-31 13:38:28,"Yesterday was my and my wife's first and last visit to this restaurant.  If I could give this place negative stars, I would.  It's too bad Yelp won't let me give it zero stars, either.  I would avoid this place at all costs, because it's a seriously disappointing waste of money.  \n\nWe ordered two dishes: the teriyaki chicken with rice and the sweet and sour chicken with brown rice, along with a couple of drinks.  At first glance, we already knew that our food would be a disappointment.  The $6.50 teriyaki chicken came to us with rice noodles, instead of steamed rice like we had ordered.  Since we were hungry, we decided to let it go and just try what they gave us.  The rice noodles used in the teriyaki chicken were of the \banh pho\"" variety, much like you'd see in Pad Thai.  However, the noodles were severely undercooked and still quite hard.  Furthermore, the \""chicken\"" was no more than small scraps of chicken randomly distributed along with a few pieces of carrots and broccoli throughout the rock hard noodles.  Surely not worth the extra ~$2 you have to pay to add a protein to your basic noodle dish.\n\nThe $7 sweet and sour chicken was composed of maybe five pieces of breaded chicken nuggets, covered with onions and bell peppers in a sweet and sour sauce, over some (again) severely undercooked brown rice.  While the sauce was a typical-tasting sweet and sour, the rice was hard and crunchy, and the onions and peppers were overcooked and soggy.  I just picked through and ate the chicken, since the rest was so unappetizing.\n\nWe spent about five minutes trying to ingest our food before we decided it was best to cut our losses and go somewhere else (which ended up being the Rumbi Island Grill next to this place).  One of the workers came by to ask if we liked our food and I just responded with \""it's alright.\""  She seemed surprised at my answer.  I suppose she would've been more surprised had I given her a more honest \""It tastes like sh!t\"" response.  Like the previous reviewer, I probably should have asked for a replacement dish, but figuring how bad they did on our two original orders, I didn't think a replacement would be any better.\n\nWe asked for some covers and a bag for our take-out bowls, and this was probably the best part of the visit there.  The bowls are sturdy, microwavable bowls, and presumably, can be used over and over again (like for bringing lunch to work).  I'll definitely be filling these with more appetizing food, at least until I feel I've made up for this waste of a trip to Mild (Undercooked) Noodles.""",qF3CYcv6,3401

I used to come and get the fire roasted green chiles and the in-house made  tortillas.  In the past, I would've given this place a 2 star for disorganization and dirtyness.  To my surprise, it was clean and put together plus they have opened up a restaurant that served Mexican bebidas, menudos, posoles, etc. \n\nMy son was intrigued with someone de-thorning the nopales (cactus pads).  \Do you eat that?\""  He asked the man.  The man nodded and pointed to the cubed ones.  I decided to buy a bag to cook at home.  I'm not a big fan, but I'd eat it.  Then, I picked up some flour tortillas and street style corn tortillas that freezes well as left overs.  One of the workers pointed us towards the indoor gateway to the restaurant.  The chiles were right before the entrance in the refrigerated section.  The small canned version doesn't do the chile justice--but it's convenient to use.  I just grabbed the $2 per bag fire roasted jalapenos without looking and assuming that it's the hatch green chile.  So, look before you take!  I wasn't disappointed with the roasted flavor when I used it as one of the condiments for my chicken and fish tacos.  \n\nWe love horchata.  It was hard not to  order one after my son and I peeked through and saw those plastic barrels full of ice cold juices!

1123,2018-04-26 12:54:45,"As soon as this place opened up a while back, I was excited to go.  I did a walk-in and with very few words, was quickly taken to a back room that is decorated in dark/warm colors with 3 comfy couches (recliners) that each have an ottoman.  As soon as I laid in the couth to relax, the lady was quick to get her supplies and immediately started.  I felt very at ease with her and she did very little talking (if anything, actually) except to ask simple questions.. not sure she knew much english besides the questions she asked.  Like everyone else says - you can't beat 1 hour massage service that extends beyond your feet and includes your legs, back and arms for $30 (fully clothed) ... oh yeah, and the little lady had AMAZING fingers and strength and just worked her butt off to make my massage thorough, relaxing, and above all, pampering.\n\nHere's where it got kinda odd.. I went again later and, again, with very few words, was whisked away to a back room.  Now, I'm not sure how other people found this place busy, but both times it has been dead empty (hence the quick seating).. a bit awkward feeling with it being that empty and quiet nd all, but maybe I go at strange times of the day/week.. dunno.  \n\nOkay, so back to my weird experience.  This time instead of a nice older lady, I got a middle-aged, VERY rotund man...also a profuse sweater .. I was pretty distracted by his heavy breathing and profuse sweating.. ewww.. I don't want to think about it anymore.  So, he was very thorough and had good force in his massge.. but I couldn't help but feel TOTALLY weird and strange when he was heavy breathing and sweating everywhere as he worked all over me... PLUS he didn't speak a lick of english (like the previous lady I had), so anything I would ask him, like \can you concentrate on my right toe - it's a bit strained\"" could not be understood.. at all (I had to resort to hand-signals, etc). \n\nI wish I could've had the option of chosing a 'therapist', but this place doesn't really work that way.. you'll see when you get there.\n\nSo, in short: great massage service (they definitely put their back in to it), great pricing, relaxing (if you don't get Mr. heavy breather who sweats everywhere).\n\nNext time I go back I'm going to request a female... if that's allowed.""",kryvaKVv,3394

However, the past Friday (Sept. 9th) was an ASU game day, and Dave's is not the place to go during this time. We ordered food, which was OK (a slider plate with onion rings (7?!?) for me, a burger and fries for my friend), and had 4 \pints\"". I put thw word in italics, because at 11:45 the \""pints\"" were small plastic cups. That isn't the terrible part, though we had ZERO interest in the \""game day\"" reasons for the cup choice. The issue is that we were charged 6 dollars each for plastic cup beer, far less in size than a true pint. This, to be blunt, is ridiculous; I like Dave's IPA, but I would have gone anywhere else for a pint had I known the cost and the size. For the beer cost and the food quality, this was a big mistake.

On Monday, I spontaneously decided to hit it up for happy hour, and had an equally excellent experience.  \My\"" table by the fire was open, so we sat there again! Happy hour was awesome (wings were delicious, as were the sliders) Bonus - on Monday nights, you can get a full burger with fries (regular or sweet potato) for only $5!

1137,2018-04-26 13:11:05,"UPDATE: 6/27/09: I've been meaning to report the devastating news (well, devastating to ME anyway). The Chandler location of zPizza closed its doors earlier this year. The Central Phoenix locations are still open, I think, but this one wasn't doing so well. Heck I'm surprised many of the other businesses in this plaza (including the Whole Foods Market there) are still open. Oh well... That sucks. :(\n\n-----------\n\nFinally! I keep meaning to check this place out. It's an 8-minute walk from my front door. And it's taken me this long. Anyway, I'm glad I finally tried it. We normally choose California Pizza Kitchen, where we never stray from the BBQ Chicken pizza, so ZPizza's BBQ was our choice by default. Something to compare, you know? \n\nWe were NOT disappointed at all! Definitely delicious. I love that we were able to order online and get it delivered (a plus, over CPK), and we were able to choose whether we wanted whole wheat crust or regular, and whether or not we wanted low-fat cheese. Health conscious as we usually are, these were excellent options. The pizza arrived in less than 45 minutes (which was the wait time they gave me), and it arrived warm and toasty - well, duh, they're right down the street from me, so I guess that was a given.\n\nOpen the box and it was beautiful. Sliced tomatoes, sweet corn, red pepper, red onions, BBQ chicken and a sprinkle of cilantro. The crust tasted great, the cheese was moist but not greasy. I do admit that the BBQ flavor was not as intense as the CPK, and they lost some points on that... When I want BBQ, i mean i really want BBQ. That is the whole point, so that was the one of the negative things I could say. They could also have added *just a little more* chicken. There was a good amount, but not enough. \n\nThe price was just right, in my opinion, for that type of pizza. A 10\ pie, $10.76, delivered. CPK is over $12 and you have to go get it.  And our delivery guy was a sweetheart, too. \n\nLooking at the menu, I may want to try some of their salads in the future. I saw that Dan L poo-poo'd the price of the salads, but I guess it's different for everyone. I will gladly pay $8-10 for a loaded salad, like the greek or the pear and gorgonzola (Large is 8.49, small is 5.49, and you can add chicken for $2.00). It seems just about the same as any other place where I eat salad. Heck Pita Jungle's is just about that much, and when i go to Salad Creations in Tempe Marketplace, if I get the big salad with all the toss-ins, plus chicken, that, too comes out to like nearly $9.00. \n\nBut I digress...\n\nOverall, the place shows a lot of promise, and we'll definitely go there more often, now that we've tried it!""",8Edfbupf,255

So yes, you might find me gluttonous, but I don't regret it for a single moment. The bruschetta are unique with their toppings and every bite is worth savoring for minutes because each mouthful is so delicious. I prefer the savory toppings (no pears, apples or figs for me), and I love all of the different combination possibilities. I think my favorite is either the warm artichoke spread or roasted peppers with goat cheese. Or maybe it's the Tomato jam & fresh sheep's milk cheese? Smoked salmon with pesto was also tasty...and let us not forget the burrata, bacon, arugula & tomatoes...although that one is probably the messiest to eat. Not that I care. I'll get messy if it means all the food is making it to my mouth.\n\nI also ordered the Italian Picnic Salad. 1) I love golden beets. 2) I love goat cheese. 3) The salad also includes walnuts and bacon. Add these things together and we're talking about a good salad. \n\nThe most recent time that I was at Postino's, I auspiciously ordered myself a bottle of wine, forgetting -for the moment- that I needed to leave two hours later. I only drank half the bottle, and started to advertise its availability to my co-workers. Thankfully, the waitress heard me, and informed me that I could just take the bottle home.

I rant and rave about how i always want to go because...I LOVE Breakfast!  Their country potatoes are to die for when you get them served fresh. Now i am not saying they have came out gross before i just do not like eating potatoes or french fries after i have left a restaurant they just aren't the same. I cant believe someone thinks their food is bland. they must have made a wrong choice somewhere.  Everything i have gotten has been amazing to say the least.  For some reason i always get the skillets and go back and forth with which one i will get.  But the most recent time i went i got their super amazing french toast that melts in your mouth like cinnabon but not as sweet where you feel as if you will die in the next hour. No the French toast is perfect but next time i will only get one slice not 6. Their biscuits and gravy are pretty damn good too. the sauce isn't watery or soupy but just amazing.  My sister has tried one of the omelletes i just cannot remember which one. i will be trying one today when i finish getting ready for the day. which of course im looking forward too. make sure when you get to crackers if you enjoy lemonade order yourself the strawberry lemonade its my favorite! More than Hot dog on a sticks lemonade which i drink on a regular basis working in the chandler mall.   \nOh one more thing...If you want superb customer service every time go to this location that is behind home depot.  I have been to the Tempe location 3 times now and 2 out of 3 times the customer service was just mediocre to poor. the most recent time a friend and i went our waiter was finally nice thank god. For some reason their hostess doesn't come off pleasant what so ever and obviously doesn't care about quality customer service on weekends(which is when i went once) .

1157,2018-04-07 19:32:21,"Tempe Marketplace is Desert Ridge's bigger, huskier, more intense yet slightly dumber brother. Made by the same development company, the layout of the place is similar (but worse) to D.R. with \The District\"" in the center, and the big stores surrounding it, separated by a vast impenetrable wasteland of parking lot. The District is an admirable concept I think. It's like a traditional mall but at least there's an attempt to move forward on it by making it outdoors? That's cool when it's nice out, but when it's 139 degrees out, the misters are in full amazon jungle force. The biggest gripe I have about the place is the layout of the place. The design is horrendous. \n\nFirst of all, it just irritates me how the giant flashy signs face the 202, beckoning unknowing, random passersby to come shop there. Meanwhile, the entire shopping center's fat ass is planted firmly and stubbornly toward Tempe, the city it's supposed to represent. The drive past Tempe Marketplace on Rio Salado features a glorious view of the backs of Pier One and Old Navy and Target's loading docks. It's ugly. And most importantly, it didn't need to be designed that way. \n\nSecondly, this place is one of the least pedestrian friendly strip malls in Tempe. Which is shitty because it's also one of the newest. Our planning and development should be propelling forward, not going backward. Does the developer know anything about the city it's in? Does it represent that? If you're going to create a mega structure like Tempe Marketplace, shouldn't it at least vaguely represent the qualities of its city? Tempe Marketplace is impossible to walk around when you're outside The District. If you wanted to, for example, walk from BevMo to Pier One, you must first throw yourself into a the middle of  a harrowing situation. There are no well designed sidewalks or walkways across the meandering, confusing road systems. You must just walk across the parking lot. Between the speeding frat boys in Mustangs and the SUV driving soccer moms who've gotta get to Sport Chalet FAST and have no time for pedestrians, Tempe Marketplace simply does not account for two major facts about its environment, and thus its consumer: people will be walking, and people will be riding bikes. And it didn't need to be designed that way. \n\nAnd then there's Big Brother-esque advertisements that are going on via loud speaker all the time. What's up with that? I love the one with the most anglo sounding chick they can find harping about how great \""San Feleep's\"" cafe is. You can't even pronounce the place's name right and you're doing an ad for it? But the music is hilarious. Sometimes it sounds like a gay club circa 1992 out there. It's like all Whitney and Technotronic. Makes me grin. \n\nThe good thing is that the Orbit (Earth) goes through T.M. The bad thing is that the Light Rail should have been a bit more accessible. Other than that, hopefully Tempe Marketplace can be an example of what not to do for other developers of similar places in the future.""",v5TEGRBe,2994

When you wash your car, reach your hand through the window and hot wax and grab a beefy little snack.  \n\nIn Phoenix, not so much.  There ARE burger places, but most often, they're a chain:  In N Out, Five Guys, Smash Burger, Fat Burger, Whataburger, etc.... and while they all vary from being pretty damn good to at least not embarrassing, it's just not the same as going to some little hidden gem, tucked between two buildings.

Decided it would be fun to get the cruiser bikes that came with our outrageous \resort fee\"" (because we got 2 hours \""free\"" each day) and ride to Press for morning coffee and brekkie.  Got on the bikes, pedaled over to N. Scottsdale Rd and we were on our way! Except.....that....I decided to check our progress after a little while and discovered we had gone the wrong way for a mile and a quarter. Sigh. Turn around, get yelled at by the hubby, kids think it's funny, and off we go. So by the time we got there, we were HUNGRY and THIRSTY! Our 5.1 mile one-way bike ride had become a little more than 7.5 miles.And let me tell you - that cappuccino tasted delicious.\n\nSo the next day, we drove. Guess what? Not as good. Still good....just not as good. The coffee was actually lukewarm when we got it. Thinking back, it was that way on the first day also...we were just unusually warm ourselves so didn't much care. Also, there was a bit too much milk for my taste....and I had purposely ordered a triple shot, knowing from the day before that they already put double shots in.  However, to be fair, this is also one of the never-resolved issues I have around wanting more espresso and less milk, but some milk, and foam, but don't want to guide someone through that whole thing.

Where else can you find the selection AND at great prices without having to be jerked around into getting a club card?! Where else can you find as many craft brews from all over?! Organic Vodka? Yes! They have always had every brand I have gone there in search of(even the elusive Christiana Vodka which I have never seen ANYWHERE else for purchase)! \n\nOk,enough with the questions marks and exclamation points, the facts are they have the biggest selection and the best prices. They blow Bev Mo and Costco out of the water.

They had a man out that day to give me a quote for removing a queen palm.  The employee was here the next day to cut the tree down.  So far so good, right?....he cut the queen palm which fell into my 26 year old Oleander Bush.  I saw it, went right out and asked him to please take it out of the bush to which he said \oh, the branches will come right back\"" and he continued to saw the other end. The branches did not come back because they are broken.  So I have a blank area in the middle of the large Oleander bush which is in the middle of my yard.  When the owner came to give me a quote, I had mentioned there were some not so good testimonials out there and he said he didn't care.  They do what they do, and that is all they care about.

1207,2018-03-28 06:44:14,"NOTE: Our stay could have been an entirely different experience had we not booked a stay the weekend after a Livingsocial.com deal was made available.  We did not buy that deal, we were regular customers...\n\nOk, starting at the beginning.  \n\n- Check-in is 4:00pm.  We got there at 3:50pm, arrived to a line of no less than 30 people.  NO rooms were available for us.  They temporarily checked us in and said we could go to the water park and call back in an hour to see if a room was ready... but, the only place to change was at the Athletic Club clear on the opposite side of the park.  By the time we hiked over there and back it was 5pm.  Our room wasn't ready until 6:40 (we called about 5 times until they finally had one ready.)  \n\n- The room was HOT.  It was on the top floor and really never cooled down, even after we removed a gross, dirty air filter (I'll be posting a picture in case you're into looking at icky stuff.)  If you're one of those people who likes it very quiet to sleep, top floor is bad.\n\n- Also, on the noise topic, our bathtub dripped so bad it sounded like the faucet was on a slow trickle the whole time.  Water wasters!  Side note, the bathroom was so small you had to step out of the way to shut the door.  A large person might need to step into the tub to shut the door. :(\n\n- Gross... there were several places of STICKY on the carpeting.  2 were right in places where normal people put their feet all the time so that was annoying and nobody should have been in that room until that was cleaned (but they were completely sold out because of the LivingSocial.com deal.)\n\n- The railings along the walkways to our room seem 'flimsy' to an acrophobe like me.  If you have small children, or rowdy older kids, you might ask for a room on a different floor.  A lower floor, closer to the ground... safer.\n\n- The Oasis water park was ok, but the staff had no continuity.  One person would allow a 47\ child to ride the slide, another wouldn't.  One day they didn't care if your floats were by your seats while you ate lunch, the next day they were collecting them just for getting out of the water.  And so on and so forth...  And any time you get a bunch of people staying at a resort they wouldn't normally be able to afford, you're going to get a class of people that are... sub-par.  We saw at least 2 instances of people just taking other peoples chaises, even when they clearly had their personal stuff (shoes, shirts) stored there.  There was considerable pushing and shoving to get in the water, lots of unsupervised, rude 8-12 year old kids.  All of this was a nuisance that probably is not a regular issue.\n\n\n\nTHE HOTEL DID TRY TO MAKE RIGHT BY US.  We only complained about having to wait for a room for so long and they ended up cutting our hotel rate in half (which was then less than those LivingSocial.com folks) and giving us vouchers for drinks (6) and enough vouchers to cover our lunch (for 6 people.)  So they were aware of how screwed up things were.  We didn't complain about the room or the park as it was so incredibly busy it didn't seem worth it.""",0V3okCw5,2635

With chef Alex Padilla's modern spin on Mexican with central americal influences, food that is artfully prepared and plated, and flavors to entice and enhance, this is one destination for your tastebuds.\n\nThe cocktails and even non-alcoholic offerings are made fresh, and are a sweet way to begin the culinary fiesta.  The \Sangria de Taberna\"" was excellent, served with fresh fruit and just the right combination of wine, brandy, and juice.  All margaritas are hand crafted and feature freshly squeezed juices - a must for a decent margarita.  They have a tremendous assortment of non alcholic offerings as well - fresh pressed juices combined with spring water and simple syrup.  We sampled pineapple, lemon, and watermelon - and each came with a juicy slice of fruit.  These were delicious!\n\nAs we were here during lunch hour, the menu had a smaller selection, but did not sacrifice on flavor.  In an unconvential move by me, I ordered the Fajita Burger.  This burger was highly recommended by the server, and I am so happy that I sampled this delectable \""Torta.\"" ( The spicy black beans with cortija were also an excellent side!)  A well seasoned and juicy skirt steak, with cheeses and peppers, doused in a garlic aoli, left beautiful memories in my mouth.  We also delighted in the Braised Chicken with Ranchera Sauce and Epazote Crema.  Chicken was also juicy and flavorful, the sauce and crema a delicious complement to the chicken.\n\nLunch menu offerings were \""Taberna Tacos,\"" street style tacos with ingredients such as grilled fish or chicken and chorizo.  Enchiladas and grilled sandwhiches were also on the menu.\n\nAverage price for an entree at luch is $12, but the fresh ingredients and flavors are worth the price.\n\nFrom the blue tortilla chips and plantains served with their flavorful salsas, to the flavorful entrees, this is a must try for Mexican food enthusiasts.""",gypcfy1D,4837

I was gonna nix the lemon capper mayo, but I figured a little wouldn't hurt. Whoa. Both slices of bread were slathered with this white stuff. Not bad taste. Just bad on the waist. \n\nThe sandwich was very, very good. Smoked salmon with sprouts on pumpernickel bread. It was very good, and I was very hungry. \n\nBut I just ordered one sandwich and it came to $7.57. That doesn't include anything else. No drink, except water (which was tap). I'm told they charge for everything here - every little extra you ask for. So, my cup of water my have cost me. Who knows. \n\nMy sandwich came with a \free\"" cookie, too.

For $7.57, I would have hoped for a sandwich large enough for me to divide between lunch and din-din. No avail. I wolfed the entire thing down happily. Even better, it didn't make me bloated later, which I feared, since most foods tend to be heavy on the salt.\n\nThe interior is a bit messy in the sense that it's chaotic. This is more of your lunch rush place. Order. Grab. Eat. Run. \n\nWhen you place your order, they ask your name. Then they call your name when it's ready.

I'm happy to see good customer service still lies on!\n\n\nThis is more of a eulogy than a review of sorts.\n\nMy wife and I arrived shortly after the 4p opening on a Saturday- preparing to enjoy a few glasses of wine and take advantage of the happy hour apps. We've been going to MWC for years, but new ownership has really taken this spot for a turn in the wrong direction. When we entered Lucy's the place was practically empty- maybe 4-5 people in total sitting on one far end of the restaurant. A woman at the bar immediately asked us if we were part of the wine club, which we replied no. She said we could seat ourselves - but as we walked around the small interior to find a place to sit- we kept getting updates that \the spot was reserved\"". Basically, when we were done walking the entire perimeter, there was no place to sit! I guess only the bar- but my wife and I really wanted a spall, quiet space to have a nice conversation and enjoy our wine (it was a rare date night without our 22-month old). WIthout any help from the staff- we simply shrugged our shoulders, gave up and walked out of the place. \n\nAs we were getting back into the car, a few questions came to mind. Why didn't that person offer a place for us to sit- you know, give some help? There was no clear indication which seats or areas were reserved for their wine club. It was confusing and shouldn't have been since the place was empty! The patio, while preferred, wasn't am option this night as it was rainy and cold. This was a huge disappointment for both of us, and we walked away extremely dissatisfied. With a place that seems to be needing business, why would they treat potential customers this way. \n\nInstead we went to Vintage 95 in Old Town Chandler and spent $100 there. We will likely never return to MWC again, and take our money and business elsewhere. With wine bars cropping up on seemingly every corner, it's pretty easy to find alternatives nowadays.

Tons of seating, just a really nice ambiance. They had a band playing good music and I could see this being quite a good first date/romantic evening place.\n\nHowever, I was just in town on business and on this particular Saturday night, I could just feel the schmoozy dude/ fake valley chick vibe. I guess if you're in to that vibe it might be cool, but it seemed like everyone was there to just be a scenester  and show off. I'm in for \a night out on the town\"", but maybe this felt a little too LA to me. Sorry LA.\n\nThe food was good, had the ribeye steak which was cooked properly with a great sauce on top, but the quality of meat was only so so. It also had cauliflower and potatoes on the side, both of which were good. There was a good selection of booze, and they carry Stella which is always my go-to beer to go with a steak. The price is quite reasonable, beer and a steak for $25 is okay in my books (or maybe I'm just used to Bay Area, CA prices?)""",i44sVaAt,4860

Plus, there was nowhere to lock up our bikes.  We headed around the corner to Local Breeze, and were told there would be a 45 minute wait.  Hey, at least they're bike-friendly!  There were several empty tables.  I asked about them, and was told \those are tables without servers.\""\n\nWe sat at one of those tables, grabbed the New Times,  went to the bar for drinks, and waited.  I'd say it was more like 20-30 minutes until we were seated.    We ordered the firecracker shrimp appetizer, which we all loved.  We sopped up as much of the flavorful sauce as possible with the included French bread.  Our only complaint was the uneven number of shrimp...11.  If there were 12, it would be evenly distributed to groups of 2, 3, 4, or 6...seems like a no-brainer.  Two of us ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad, and one ordered the Ribeye with Gorgonzola.  When our food arrived, the presentation was impressive.  However, the actual food left a lot to be desired.  My friend ordered her steak medium, and it was just too bloody for her taste.  She finally decided to send it back.  Our salads looked lovely, but the tuna was not at all seared.  It was a little raw in the middle, with none of the savory goodness of a well-cooked piece of fish.  While the greens were very fresh and tender, we both felt there was too much roasted red pepper on top of them.  Roasted red pepper is a wonderful accent, but more is not necessarily better.  The salad was supposed to come with a wasabi aioli, which we did not see anywhere on our plates.  The cilantro lime dressing was fantastic.  I would've been happier with less quantity and more quality.""",7nbiPCJ7,3883

He attended to us with aplomb, ensuring we were all comfortable, and had drinks, prior to the feast commencing.\n\nI partook of the Big Daddy's BBQ Honey Ale, which was served ice cold in a frosty mug.\n\nThis is a beer to savor. This is a beer that makes the heat dissipate, and settles the nerves. Delicious, subtle, not too heavy.\n\nWe began our feeding frenzy with the house smoked wings. They are served with a dipping sauce, but if you appreciate the beauty of smoked meats, you won't have need of it. Drumettes and wings are served, along with the obligatory celery sticks.\n\nRefreshingly absent was sign of ranch dressing. That alone made me smile.\n(Yes, S.L., I thought of you...)\n\nNext we were treated to fried pickles. They were still very hot, but that only made them that more scrumptious! They did have something akin to ranch sauce, but I did not dip, as there was no need.\n\nThen began the cavalcade of smoked meat;\nribs and brisket, smoked for 14-16 hours, served on a platter, with the custom house bbq sauce;\npulled pork, smoked for 4 hours, served with the house bbq sauce;\ntri-tip, served with the house bbq sauce\n\nThe ribs were un-frikkin-believably good. Best ribs I've ever had in my adult life, hands down. They use a proprietary rub, that we were informed would soon be available for purchase. I considered lifting some from the kitchen, it was so good.\n\nThe brisket was tender and juicy, and oh so good.\nTri-tip should always aspire to what Big Daddy's produces. The color was perfect, as was the texture and flavor.\n\nThe pulled pork was so good, you could eat it with a fork, right off the platter, and you would never get a weird look from anyone. Mostly because they would also be doing it.\nThe pork also comes with perfect-sized, grilled slider buns.\n\nWe were also provided with baked beans, that were sweet, but with a slight bite to them that cut the sweetness.\nThe cornbread was devine; cake-y, and slightly sweet, but a perfect addition to any bbq meal.\nThe cole slaw was good, but nothing great. It doesn't need improvement.\nSweet potato french fries, with cinnamon and sugar, made a nice complement to the meal.\n\nFor me, however, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, the highlight of the evening, was the mac and cheese.\nAccording to Oliver, they cook 50 pounds of raw pasta a day, which equates to 150 pounds of mac, before the cheese.\nI could not believe it was only 50 pounds.\n\nMade with several different kinds of cheese, panned, then baked, to crisp the top.\n\nThis was one of the three best mac and cheese dishes I've ever had in my life.\n\nAnd I know mac and cheese.\n\nI had to bring some home it was so good.\n\nThe decor consists of picnic tables, with umbrellas, and has a general \ranch\"" kind of feel. Perfect for a redneck like me!\n\nThey also have a patio, replete with misters for the Arizona heat. There are also a couple large, garage-style doors, that are opened in the evening, providing an outdoorsy kind of feel to the entire dining area.\n\nThere is shuffleboard available in the bar, and a miniature \""General Store\"" area, with golden oldies such as \""Boston Baked Beans\"" candy.\n\nAnd last, but surely not least, each meal comes with a casino chip, that you may save for a future visit (yeah right!), or cash in right away, for a dessert treat.\nThe dessert choices are those you would find on an ice-cream truck;\nDrumstick, ice cream bar, chocolate-chip cookie ice cream sandwich, bullets, etc.\n\nI will return to Big Daddy's, and I will bring my children. I'm certain we will all leave very happy, and VERY full.""",VLFDGSLa,4776

Quit charging covers several days of the week. Improve your service, offer better entertainment, and clean the dump up and your bar will be packed. \n\n2. Crappy service. Apart from a couple nice bartenders, a lot of the help needs an attitude adjustment. Newsflash: nobody is obligated to spend their money at your establishment. You earn it through good service and decent attitude. I give my all when I work to make sure people are satisfied. I expect the same from other businesses.

My wife ended being pretty full after the. 4th course, so struggled a bit, but didn't want to miss anything! All of the little \amuse bouche\"" kept us entertained between courses. Overall, we had great service, amazing food and a good time.  Certainly don't go here with any budget considerations though...""",gUrs8gff,2977

Although a lot of stores have left the mall, there have been some fantastic additions: Banana Republic, J.Crew and BCBG. Banana Republic and J.Crew tend to have some really good sales, and if you are looking for some cute dresses, BCBG has an awesome selection of them. Oh, and although it isn't new, their Ann Taylor Outlet store is also a great place to find awesome deals.\n\nAnother great thing about this mall is that during the holidays they have a huge Christmas tree lighting event.  The tree is supposedly the tallest, \animated\"" Christmas tree in Arizona (not sure what animated means.) This weekend was the lighting ceremony and it looked like it was going to be a big event.\n\nThe mall also seems to be a very family-friendly and pet-friendly place, with a play area for kids and a lot of benches and grassy areas to hang out with your furry friends. It also seems to be quite the destination for a lot of out-of-town and foreign tourists, so be weary of crowds and sometimes confused and pushy people. \n\nMy hope for the Outlets at Anthem is that they continue bringing in a good variety of stores (Coach, please!!!) and possibly expand to include a department stores.

Made reservations and were seated within 5 minutes of arriving. Servers brought out an adorable olive tray with green and kalmata olives. Our server (Dominic?) was extremely attentive and knowledgable when I asked about the wines and my date inquired about the beer, and his timing was good. They offer wine by the standard glass and bottle, but they also offer by a glass-and-a-half. This was a perfect pour.\n\nWe skipped appetizers and I ordered the pasta bolognese while my boyfriend opted for the chicken parmigiana. After we ordered, we were brought bread and a roasted tomato butter. This was very tasty. My bolognese arrived with giant shells as the pasta, with large shavings of parmesan on top. It was delicous, with the exception of having fennel in it (which is just a personal preference!). I ate almost all of it. Sadly, we found the chicken parm to be a little bland. \n\nTo end the evening we ordered the \""nutella mousse cake\"" which sounded amazing but was also a bit disappointing. We ate about half of it and when our waiter asked how it was and our response was mediocre, he insisted on comping the dish even though we had eaten half of it. This got big points in my book. He said \""if you don't absolutely love it, I can't charge you for it\"". Our bill for two after a good tip for the waiter was about $70.\n\nOverall, I recommend NoRTH.  the only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because the parm was a little bland and it was a bit pricey. If you are looking for a nice evening out (and are ready to spend a bit) it is appropriate, but for pasta or pizza, go to \""Sauce\"".""",23pTDosK,445

No big deal--when I couldn't find the iron (everything's located in little hidey-holes around the room--there was a space behind the bed that had the iron on a shelf). The bed was comfy, the shower was great, and most of all , it was clean and quiet. If you're easily amused or stoned, the floor of the elevator consists of panels with some liquid under them, and you can move your feet around and watch the pretty bubbles and patterns, The only problem I had was at checkout, when they seemed to charge me twice for one glass of wine (they may have thought that I was too drunk to remember having ordered a second glass).

1332,2018-01-06 07:20:45,"Gosh, I spent about 2 hours here, but enjoyed every second of it thanks to some amazing food.\n\nWe started off with some calamari and wings. While I'm not a big fan of calamari, I absolutely LOVE wings. Oregano's wings were pretty damn amazing. It has to be up there with the top 1% of wings I've tried. The timing of the appetizers was pretty nice as well. Calamari came out first, then the wings shortly after, and finally...\n\nTHE AMAZING PIZZA. wow. the chicago pan crust pizza was simply perfection. everything was perfect about it. the only downside was that it came straight out of the oven to our table, and so if you tried to get a slice everything would fall off. My advice would be to wait for the pizza to cool off before you even attempted to take a slice. Other than that, try not to cream in your mouth from the orgasm you'll have from eating this slice of amazingness. Seriously, it is perfect in so many ways. The crust has an amazing texture, the cheese is perfectly melted, the toppings aren't crap, and the sauce is the pinnacle of evolution and mother nature.\n\nTo top off all of this, it was cheap. I think we paid $20 for calamari, 9 wings, and a 10\ pan pizza with 2 sodas. Now I'm confused if that is actually how much we paid...\n\nI suppose the one thing we didn't try was the pizza cookie...oh well, now I have an excuse to go back.""",NJk77CaN,639

More like In-n-Out Burger. I got the double char with Swiss and it was good and fresh tasting and the onion rings were good also. Friendly staff and bright clean space although it was sad to see it was the old My Florist Cafe which was a great place.. At least they are keeping the sign up. All in all a good place to grab a burger.,36PEMYhw,185

My favorite is their Monaco omelet and Mexican Coffee.\n\nI would give this five stars if 1) the owner would take the time to actually crack a smile.  Her chilly demeanor can be intimidating.  And 2) if service was better.  There are times where I would have to wait forever before being acknowledged.,hVDIKC0H,2693

I ordered the stromboli with sausage, crimini mushrooms and fontina, which was prepared and presented to me with a delicious, light bread crust that literally melted in my mouth. It was perfect. The setting is also pleasant and relaxing, with plenty of outdoor seating to enjoy our great weather, and an \interior\"" that's opened up to the outside so you barely feel like you're \""inside\"".

No, we didn't have any kids with us but we may have had a better time than most of the kids.\n\nThe beginning is a bit dry. You're in the \classroom\"" for a while learning about random facts related to diary cows.  Moo.  After that, it's a hay ride.  Girls, let me give you one tip - Make sure you wear long pants or shorts that are long.  Hay is very uncomfortable under your butt if there isn't enough padding.  Anyway, the hay ride was entertaining but the best part had yet to come.\n\nOnce the hayride was over, the \""tour\"" was officially over.  But everyone stuck around to check out the petting zoo. The animals were all so friendly and we got to feed them as well.  There was a hodgepodge of creatures from a young cow to sheep to rabbits and even a turkey.  Yum...just kidding.\n\nIn addition, there's a black lab on the premise that was amazing.  This dog would make an incredible soccer player.  His reaction time is unbelievable - any team would be happy to have him as a goalie.\n\nAfter the animal bonding, we went to try flavored milk.  Mine was butterscotch flavored and it was just ok.  I was disappointed that the milk wasn't fresh from the farm but I guess it's not legal to serve unprocessed milk.  Since we had a Groupon, we also had a chance to try Udder Delights ice cream. At $2.50 each, I would never pay for them individually. But seeing that it was included in my \""deal,\"" we enjoyed them a lot.\n\nDon't be embarrassed if you don't have kids.

With an awesome mix of Old School Funk, Reggae, Classic Rock, and even a little Santana action, the live band was ON POINT! We were singing and dancing to every song! The crowd was fairly diverse and everyone was friendly. I could definitely see this as a relaxing place to go after a long day, where you don't necessarily have to wear \club attire\"" to fit in.

A movie where it's best to eat at the beginning, because you probably won't want to later. At least I didn't. \n\nEveryone has covered the basics of what and how this place operates so I won't reiterate. I love the concept, and feel like they've done a really good job with one or two exceptions. The place looks great and is very comfortable. Service is largely unobtrusive, but hard to flag without the buzzer. And the ladies room wastebasket was overflowing with paper towels all on the floor - before the movie started.\n\nI liked the music videos / live REM concert video before the movie started. I was hoping this meant no ads beforehand but I was wrong. \n\nWhat I found lacking was the food. We ordered the crab dip and grilled chicken bruschetta. The bread served with the dip was dry and stale. Didn't taste particularly real, which I thought given the ($10.95?) price, should have been a given. The bruschetta was ok, but again, the cheese tasted a little bit weird. It wasn't bad, really, just not good. \n\nOh and MHA also asked me to mention that his popcorn (a must have for him) didn't seem like \movie\"" popcorn and the real butter was cold and congealed. With all this, I also thought the food was overpriced. If it was better, I wouldn't so much mind the $60+ total for 2 tickets, 2 appetizers, 1 popcorn and 2 beers, but ...\n\nI am torn, though - I really love the concept and would like to go again.

But several were from newbies to sushi, so I was skeptical, even with a recent ROTD. Had to try for myself.\n\nYasu's is in the Target/REI mall on the corner of East Cactus and Paradise Valley Parkway West, on the edge of Scottsdale and PV, adjacent the Army Recruiting office! \n\nThe restaurant is immediately recognizable as Japanese owned, by its tasteful and elegant decor in subdued natural tones of wood and stone colors. Clean, modern, with understated class and attention to detail. It isn't large, with only 10 tables inside, 8 4s, a cozy 2 by the sushi bar, and a 6 in front of it, with a small L shaped stool bar next to the sushi bar which only has 2 benches seating 2 each. Outside are 3 more tables in a fenced patio with Tiki lamps aburning. There is a hostess, a Japanese floor manager, several youthful Eurasian servers, and a mostly Latino kitchen staff. Yasu and Takeshi do all the sushi behind the sushi bar, and pace each diner well. \n\nThey specialize in a daily special menu. Samples for a Friday night included:\n- Kampachi (baby yellowtail) $12\n- Kumamoto Oysters (half shel or Sumibi) $10\n- Aji (Spanish Mackerel) or Striped Jack sushi or sashimi ($5.5/$12 and $7.5/$16 respectively)\n- Whole Black Snapper (from the Sumibi Yaki Grill) $20\n- Saikyo Beef Tongue ($8)\n- Grilled Pike ($8.5)\n- Grilled Squid Surume ($13.5)\n- 5 oz Wagyu ($75)\n- Cornflake Shrimp w/Tartar Sauce ($8.5)\n- Karaage Black Snapper ($22)\n- Sake or Miso Steamed Manila Clams ($8.5/$9)\n- Foie Gras w/ Japanese Eggplant $13.5 \nObviously from other reviews, many of these are standard faire daily. \n\nSushi is moderately priced, with basic Nigiri from $4.5 - $5; Exceptions are sweet shrimp ($8), Crab Leg ($6.5) Uni and Mirugai ($7.5). Sashimi are reasonable from $7.5 - $10. Rolls from $4 (Maki type) up to $12 max (hand styled). \n\nI went for a $50 Omakase (I count on you, chef) and Takeshi went to work. \n\n1. Duo Cherrystone Clams on half shell atop its own caligraphy covered ceramic charcoal hotpot, garnished with minced green onions, fresh ginger and a dab of spicy tuna mix, doused with Ponzu sauce, taken to a boil in front of you. OMG! AYKM? ($7.5)\n2. Crystal white Himame (Fluke) fish garnished with minced green onions, morsels of katsuyaboshi (bonita shavings), ponzu, and shaped and decorated to look like a mini sperm whale with eyes and gills ($5.5)\n3. Hard to find Striped Jack (Shimajii) red striped white fish au natural ($7.5)\n4. Saba (Mackerel) served without garnish ($4.5)\n5. Seki-Saba (special mackerel only bought in 2 places in Japan, just arrived today) $6 (smoothest, melt like butter Mackerel you will find!)\n6. Sake (Salmon) Yasu Style: Scored, seared on the Sumibi Yaki Grill for a smokey flavor, sprinked with ponzu sauce (don't dip into shoyu/wasabi!). Best tasting salmon I have had! Soft and flavorful! ($4.5)\n7. 4 inch long narrow hand roll filled with buttery Uni and a hint of spice ($7.5)\n\nTotal with $6 large Asahi Super Dry: $49.\n\nI waited 20 minutes for the sushi bar, and as it happens that I was a single, another single came nearly simultaneously, and we talked, shared sushi, and with Japanese politeness, poured each other's drinks. I shared sushi, and they shared Seared Scallop Carpaccio, which were about 8 small sand dollar sized scallop slices, very tender and white, garnished with minced negi, katsuyoboshi, and ponzu.\n\nI complimented Takeshi (Umai, Oishikatta, Subarashii!) and left him a $20 bill because I was so happy! (I tipped the wait staff, too)\n\nAnything Asian with \Bistro\"" in the name makes me a bit nervous that it is some convaluted Fusion Crap joint trying too hard to be Hip and Chic. Not the case here!\n\nYasu's rivals other sushi-ya in LA, SD, SF, LV and Seattle, and costs less than ones of equal quality and creativity. I highly recommend it!""",SCmEMmdl,3806

1367,2018-01-21 02:19:02,"Driving to Peoria, Arizona to join some friends and watch some Padres spring training baseball.  We drove through a little town named Gila Bend.  Gila Bend can best be described as one of the towns where you fill your gas tank and grab a bite to eat.  It's not actually a destination where people plan to go but a place that is on the path to where you are really going.\nIn Gila Bend, they have a few motels and a MickeyD's.  The bright spot of the whole place is a Dairy Queen right on the main road.  Driving to Arizona we needed to find a place we could go to the bathroom, a place where we could have our dogs go to the bathroom and a place where we could get something to eat on the road.  Dairy Queen was the answer.\nThis particular Dairy Queen had public restrooms on the outside.  I was very surprised that the restrooms weren't locked like most places.  I even went inside to ask for a \key\"".  The employees inside nicely said that there was no key.  To top that off, the men's restroom was clean- woo hoo!  I don't have to tell you how restrooms like these usaully are.  So it was a big relief.  There was also plenty of dirt parking lot for my dogs to do there thing. \nAfter that we went through the drive through.  I ordered a oreo cookie blizzard that was the bomb.  My wife ordered a ice cream sandwich, a corn dog and fries with a coke.  My wife gave me some of her fries and they were so good.  I laughed because my wife started with the ice cream sandwich first.\nWe liked it so much that on the way home a few days later.  We went to Dairy Queen again.  This time I ordered a double cheese burger, onion rings and a coke.  My wife ordered the same thing she ordered last time.  Again she ate the ice cream sandwich first, lol.\nI have to say that the double cheese burger was the best I have eaten in a long while and the onion rings were especially good.  Didn't expect the food to be this good but it was.  If you are in Gila Bend, pass on MickeyD's and get some Dairy Queen.\nFunny side note, the service is really good.  The girls that work there are very nice.  The first trip, I wanted to tip the drive thru girl but I didn't have any cash on hand so I tipped her with a hand full of change.  On the way back, the same girl was at the drive thru.  I asked if she remembered me.  At first she said \""no\"" but when I mentioned the change she remembered and laughed.  I ended tipping her three dollars.  \nThe prices are cheap.  The food is awesome.  The service is good.  I don't usually sing the praises of fast food joints but this place is different.  If you are driving through Gila Bend, Dairy Queen is the answer.""",DzRWytfj,3216

I had my dad try some and my sister-in-law and my dad deemed it inedible.  \n\nMy Dad, poor thing, ordered the fish tacos.

1407,2018-03-22 21:06:12,I went to Dr. Walker for a long time. I thought Dr. Walker was a good dentist until I changed dentists. I had an issue with the front receptionist(his wife) who kept telling me I had a deductible to pay. Least to say - one phone call from me to my insurance company(which the receptionist could have done) was all that was needed to clear up the confusion.  By that time I was pretty ticked by the way the receptionist treated me so I decided to go with another dentist that was recommended to me by a friend.\n\nProblem started when I went to the new dentist to have two cavities filled that Dr. Walker advised me of at my last cleaning(1 month prior).  Well it turns out I had 8 cavities and one was from a prior fill that Dr. Walker had completed approximately two years before. I understand missing one cavity but 6 others? Are you kidding me?! Not only that but I went for a second opinion to make sure I wasn't being fooled but modern-day medical over diagnosis. That dentist also confirmed the truth - 8 cavities and a possible root canal if the prior cavity filled was too deep to fix. Not only did they show me the x-rays but also the photos of the black holes and pits.  Several had been there for more than 6 months and probably more than a year. And I go to the dentist every 6 months - I like my teeth clean and that awesome feeling that there are no icky cavities. \n\nJust an FYI - Dr. Walker said I had stains on my teeth and they were definitely not stains.

The quality is mediocre. Next in line are assorted veggies, tofu, and then an array of sauces.  You pick and choose.  As you fill up the bowl, people are using those wax sheets to moosh down the food to maximize space.  Add an item then smoosh.  Repeat.\n\nThe meal comes with soda, soup, rice, and frozen yogurt machine.  The best part of the meal was the service.  They are continually replenishing the ingredients and ensuring a cleaning station.  The cashier walked around to check on everyone's meal.

One person in my party (there were three of us) asked for extra dressing with her salad, when she needed it (about 15 minutes into the meal) she finally just got up and went to ask for it.

The service is comparable to the Beverly Hills Hotel. An example is: we asked about a restaurant and they brought reviews to us; and when we decided to dine there, they made reservations and printed a map. Everything was waiting in an envelope when we went to get our car for the evening. We are treated so well, weather we are in a smaller summer discount room or a suite in March for spring training. The employees of The Royal Palms Inn will go out of there way to assist you to the best of their ability, we did not hear \no\"" with out a very valid reason; and they came up with alternatives.

The ceaser salad looked good and I think was like 2.75...no really, you read that right.  The entrees were yummy, a au jus type of sandwhich and I got some pasta special....all very good. \n\nAnd the best part, if I checked in I got 10 dollars off.  All of this food, plus coffee came to 42.00.  \n\nThe drink menu looked yummy, full of fancy cocktails, but we couldn't partake...as we had to drive to Globe Arizona...but we ordered two coffees to keep us awake...because the ride is boring to globe...only weird thing, no to go coffee cups, wtf?

I should know these happen to be some of the BEST places for a meal. \n\nWe decided on this place after my son did a little research on Mariscos Restaurants in the area. It was in celebration of my hubs \26th\"" birthday and his craving for Mariscos. \n\nUpon pulling up to the restaurant we gave each other questionable look due  to the size of the restaurant and neighborhood, but it quickly discipitated upon entrance. Beautifuuul, colorful decor. Very clean and plenty of seating with a full bar. We chose seats and our waitress came over for our drink order. In addition to the traditional chips and salsa we were also brought ceviche tostadas.. ON THE HOUSE. I personally liked both salsas and the chips were thin and crispy and fresh. Hubs wasn't feeling either the red or green salsa.\n\nI ordered the fish tacos - FABULOUS. I was expecting fried fish and cream sauce but received fresh grilled fish with a sprinkling of cheese. I was a liitle doubtful but with my first bit I was in love. Sooooo good and so flavorful without the guilt that comes with eating fried food. The rice is not a tomato based rice, flavorful nonetheless, white with veggies. Very good. The beans were also very good, reminded me of grandmas.\n\nWe all tasted each others food and there was not one thing I didn't love. My daughter got the Shrimp Ranchera.. fresh, delicious shrimp and veggies in a light, lemony sauce. My son got the Molcajete Caliente.. GREAT dish to share. The meat, and the fish were the BEST. The sauce was nice and smokey and had just a full great flavor to it. Hubs got a seafood cocktail depsite my coaxing into getting a pescado frito. I wanted a taste :/ His cocktail was very good despite them using canned clams rather than fresh. \n\nThis has quickly become my new favorite Mariscos spot in AZ.

The girl who answered quickly mumbled, \""Ok, be right there\"" and hung up before I could reply. I went inside at that point, and asked to speak with the manager. No one would say why it was taking so long (I suspect someone forgot) but the manager had already comped a few flan desserts (not bad for being so cheap). When I explained that this visit was a disappointment, after so many other, very satisfying experiences, the manager asked for my receipt and promptly refunded every cent. I didn't even ask.

I figured anyone from Cali must know what they're doing with their pho.\n\nLet's start from the beginning.  When you walk in, they restaurant has a very clean atmosphere for a pho/Asian place.  The service is friendly and the prices are exactly what pho should cost - around $5 or 6.\n\nOnto the food...  The pho is not the BEST I've ever had, but it is GOOD.  They give you plenty of meat and it doesn't sit in the hot broth too long before they bring it out, so it has that perfect soft melt in your mouth texture rather than some places that make 'em way too chewy.  The noodles could be more aldante, but it wasn't overly bloated.  The broth was the only dept they could use an improvement in, as that was the part of the pho I thought was subpar.  Don't get me wrong, I think their pho is great and I plan on going back lots of times.\n\nOne of my fav things about this place are their spring rolls and the selection of drinks.  The spring rolls are cheap, well wrapped, and they put plenty of mint in them.  Just to warn ya, if you read the previous reviews and order the great \pomegranite\"" drink, it's not pomegranite.  They're little red jellie balls - but it is one of my favorite vietnamese drinks and I always get one when I go here.  \n\nBTW, my rating is completely based on their pho.  I tried the charbroiled beef bun once and it was definitely dissapointing.  Meat was dry, it had more noodles than vegis, and not enough flavor.\n\nI haven't tried other pho places in AZ, so I'll update my reviews once I can compare them to the other local restaurants.  =)""",UtYAXvk3,2124

I really hope I never become lactose intolerant. Because I don't think it would stop me from devouring cheese plates like they're going out of style, but it would make the aftermath upsetting. Anyway, their list is robust and I've yet to try something I don't like. The Roaring '40s blue is excellent. Idiazabal was like a Spanish manchego, but smokier. The manchego was hard and nutty and delicious. The Chimay Grand Cru made great use of its Belgian beer namesake and was smooth and a bit soft.\n\nWould you think I was weird if I said the Hoch Ybrig tasted like a Swiss mountain meadow?

1463,2018-03-04 14:22:16,"Pleasantly surprised... that's how I would describe my experience at this posh Mid-North Scottsdale Asian inspired restaurant. I was here for a Yelp event, so money wasn't an issue... price seems to be a deterrent for many people, but honestly - we had 5 menu items and two drinks each, and the bill was below 80 bucks for both of us (it was free, but we asked how much it would've been). That's pretty reasonable. We was expecting it to be much more. \n\nThe ambiance was pretty fancy-pants... a little too fru-fru for my tastes, but it was nice inside. Great wood-top bar with clean lines and modern touches inside. The evening started out very bright and well-lit and then during service the lights turned down to suit the mood. Outside, the building is unassuming and dull like any other shitty NoSco strip mall looking thing, but inside is a much different story. It's an open and airy space. \n\nOn to the food... holy shit. Fucking delicious. I would've ordered none of what I ate - ever. None of it pleases my pallet on paper, but I was brave and popped it all into my mouth and enjoyed every scrumptious bite. Our server happened to be fantastic, but our friends had a different experience. I think your mileage may vary here as far as service goes, but the food is very good. \n\nBy the way... I peeked into the bathroom, and I have no idea how a 5'9\ woman could sit on a toilet here and her feet wouldn't touch the ground - that's absurd. \n\nThis probably won't ever be my first or second or third choice for a place to go for a good meal and a drink, but honestly I may consider going here sometime even if I have to pay. My biggest problem with the place would be that I wouldn't know what to order. I liked that we didn't really have a choice in this particular case. \n\nI don't know who this place would appeal to... because it's really not meant for people like me. I'm more at home at British Open Pub (which is where we went afterwards), but judging by the non-yelper crowd there, I would say wealthy Scottsdale and Paradise Valley people in the area between 30 and 60 would really enjoy this joint. Maybe the crowd changes to younger folk on the weekends. But even though it's not my kind of place, I had a good time and would recommend it to someone who asked if it was good.""",JAWqoH05,931

He was kind of yelled at, but eventually got it.  The customer service isn't the best, but the food sure is good. \n\nAs we were leaving, a guy (who I had seen inside the restaurant) who was walking by our car, turned around and came up to our window. My friend who was driving had to ask if she should roll it down or not. She finally did, but kept moving it up and down while he was talking like it was broken. I was too busy laughing while she had to tell the already-drunk-at-noon guy we didn't have any cash for him. All in good fun. \n\nI'm pretty much always good for a crazy adventure when I go out and this was no exception. Go and check out the food. You'll enjoy it and maybe even get an adventure while you're at it. \n\nTips: The place is small with few tables so go early or later if you can. It is CASH ONLY, so be prepared.""",M6MO24Sl,1210

Try the rosemary bread or the focaccia. Love that they have the olive oil tasting bar. I like the blood orange olive oil as well as the dipping olive oil with all the herbs. They also have a huge selection of olives and vinegar, as well as olive oil based bath products. This is a great place to buy a locally made gift.\n\nThe restaurant \del Piero\"" was disappointing for me for the same reason I see others have mentioned. The food was straight up COLD. Waffles, frittata, and eggs benedict as well as the potatoes that came on the side...all cold. And I should mention that this was a Thursday morning and we were the first people in the restaurant, so there is no good excuse for this. The food looked beautiful though, and the potatoes were absolutely delicious with skin on and a citrusy herb flavor. My frittata came atop their amazing focaccia bread and had very fresh tomato and perfect avocado on top. The fruit salad that accompanied our dishes was 90% honeydew. I wish honeydew could be abolished from restaurant fruit salad. Is it an expense thing I wonder? Regular cantaloupe is so much more flavorful if you are intent on serving melon.""",O9PWlkr1,4973

Basically, you're supposed to walk around the outside of the room, order in the corner, then walk around the counter back towards the middle and pay and get your food right in front of the door.  It seems like a good system, but I've not seen it yet with a ton of customers, so who knows.\n\nI'd say this place is at least marginally better than Subway or Port-o-subs, plus they have soups, salads, some breakfast options till 10:30, and coffee and shakes, so you should go check it out.""",YL7c0wfM,3845

1493,2018-01-12 01:46:22,"The best thing about NYC are the DDs all over, and the fact that people bring donuts to every meeting held before 11 AM.  This DD does a mean job with the classic plain old fashioned, which I consider the litmus test of a donut shop.  So, while a good donut is always tops in my book, why only 3 stars?  It's the Christown Walmart version of DDs.  It is almost always crowded, and with people who talk really loudly with lots of \ain't got none\"" and \""they don't got none a that\"" phrases thrown in.  I went on Saturday and was sandwiched between a woman with half her top teeth totally knocked out who kept yelling at a friend who was seated at a table (lot's of \""ain't\""s and things thrown in), and a guy who was crowing about how he's being paid to stand in line because's on the \""shop run\"" getting donuts for the guys at the shop....  now there's lots of people in the world, but when the line is 40 people long, why do they talk like we ALL want to her about it??  And there was a guy waiting up by the counter with a dog on a leash.  A somewhat scraggly looking pit bull.  No indication whatsoever that it was a service dog.  On top of all this, I got stuck behind a lady and her daughter that considered the selection of their dozen as the most critical decision of the year and held up all the loud-talkers in line behind them. The wait was interminable.\n\nAccess is also an issue - it's tough to make a left hand turn into the place and virtually impossible to make a left hand turn getting out.  The line can get so long in the drive through that it blocks in some of the parked cars.\n\nWhy this is the only north-central DD is beyond my comprehension, and my love of the donuts is the only thing that keeps me coming back.""",hOvZN7jL,997

Hey, I'm not a pickle fan either, but that doesn't stop me deep throating their sammiches. (insert gay joke here).  They could'a called the place \Red Hot Fermented Cucumber\"".  Yeah, that's nice...\n\nFYI,  They also have a table that resembles a pickle;  not just shaped like pickle, but RESEMBLES a god damn, translucent green Mother effin' pickle. Gigity.    \n\nSecond:    Food    -    The first time I ate here, I had a turkey samich with some corn on it and some mildly spicey salsa.  It didn't create the euphoric mexican high I had hoped for, but I remember thinking \""damn that is one freshly made sammy\""  Fresh...  F - R - E - S - H.

Be mentally prepared for a large check or you won't enjoy.\n\nI ordered a vodka martini, thinking I would have a red wine with dinner.  My $18 martini (including the extra in the shaker) ended up lasting through dinner and refilled my glass twice (last one was mostly water, but still...).  Doing some advanced math, one $18 martini is approximately... $2 cheaper than a $10 martini and a $10 glass of wine.  What a bargain!\n\nOnce every couple weeks I go to AJ's and overpay for some good filets, and despite my ineptitude with a grill they are awesome every time.  The filet I had at Mastro's BLEW AWAY my attempts at steakery.   I broke one of the ten commandments, I can't remember which one, and ordered it medium instead of medium rare, but it didn't matter.  I  savored every bite, in that way you can only savor a really really good steak.  And for $40 bucks I should be savoring.\n\nThe sides are all good - I''ve never had one I didn't like.\n\nTwo minor complaints - 1) maybe we were too close to the live music, because I couldn't hear a word my tablemates said; and 2) my wife ordered a house or chopped salad, but was brought some weird salad with crab. Probably because (see complaint #1) the waiter could not hear her.\n\nAnyway, if you want a restaurant to enjoy a special occasion, head to any of the Mastro's places.

1533,2018-05-15 08:40:04,"Blue Agave's fish tacos are like wow. Best place (next to Central Phoenix's Barrio Cantina) to go for fish tacos. But apart from that, their menu is good, not incredible. \n\nI second what someone else said - that it's kind of \Scottsdalian Mexican food.\""  It's definitely not authentic, kind of modded up for the trendiness of North Scottsdale, and I think the prices reflect that as well.  I wouldn't say it's grossly overpriced, but I'd say it's right at the point where if they charged any more it'd be a rip off. \n\nAs it is the place is always clean with fresh salsa and tasty food, plenty of beer and margaritas to go around. I recommend it highly as it's not a chain - and for that alone I like it - and for a comfortable and clean atmosphere for a good night out.  I've also been told that it turns into more of a club on weekends, sad to say I've never been there to see that - but I'm sure it's pretty good spot (well, as good as they come in North Scottsdale).  \n\nNow, having finished my review, I'm thinking back - I like Blue Agave, but I LOVE Pinatas.

1535,2018-01-16 15:24:02,"If I were to rate solely on tea, I would give Tea Infusion four stars.  The list of teas is impressive.  Everything from black teas to herbal teas, flavored blacks to greens, herbals to mates, white teas to oolong, rooibos to seasonal infusions.  \n\nMy first taste here was the chocolate Chai.  The decision was difficult as I had other \Chai\"" options.  The descriptions alone are seductive.  Such as the \""Kama Sutra Chai\"" with its \""sensuous floral and saucy notes\"" that will \""make memories.\"" \n\nThe Chocolate Chai was the best Chai I have ever tried, not to mention that it was chocolate.  More specifically, I was enjoying a blend of \""Malabar Coast spices with sweet caramel\"" that had a Belgian chocolate finish to die for.\n\nI perused the list of Green Teas, and found about a dozen varieties ranging from a Pinhead Gunpowder to an Organic Moroccan Mint.  I sampled the Sweet Almond Green tea, which was just right as an iced tea and required no additional sweetening with the touch of  Sweet Almond.\n\nFor those that prefer their beverages decaffeinated, there are a great selection of herbal teas.  The flavors are fun and bold, such as the \""Cookie Monster\"" with a blend of caramel, fruit, and almonds - or the Bella Coola with orange and pineapple. \n\nEach of their featured teas have distinct characteristics and health benefits.  Amongst them are the white teas - which have a higher price point, average being $10.  I gather it is due to the fact that the process involves only selecting the youngest tea leaves, and they have to have that signature white fuzz.  They are also high in catechins, which help reduce cholesterol (among many other things).  Furthermore, its antioxidant properties fight carcinogens and bolster immunity.  The \""Silver Needles\"", one of China's best white teas, would be a selection to introduce yourself to this fine tea.\n\nSo on to the food.  I strongly suggest that you do not make it a point to dine here.  It may impact your tea experience.  I ordered the California BLT, which is a bacon lettuce tomato with avocado.  They were out of tomatoes, and wanted to substitute red peppers to which I said no.  When I got the sandwich there were no avocados, just a sad looking smear of guacamole.  A piece of lettuce and four strips of bacon on sourdough came to $6.99.  I also ordered the Tuna melt for $6.59.  Rye bread with a miserable amount of white tuna, a piece of lettuce, and barely discernable cheese.  Although the sandwich was warm, it merely seemed the bread had been toasted.  \n\nI waited more than ten minutes for those two sandwiches, and was the only patron to have ordered food - so I had assumed that it was worth the wait.  But expect to be disappointed.  The menu listed that the melt was made with Swiss, to which the kitchen staff informed me that sadly they were out of Swiss.  Although I was given an equally satisfying substitute, Provolone, I barely noticed it was there.\n\nI had read in other reviews that they \""ran out\"" of ingredients.  I feel this is something that needs to be addressed and duly noted by management.\n\nSo, I want to reiterate that for a great tea tasting experience this is a wonderful destination.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  For food on the go, I suggest you go somewhere else.""",dgdmraoS,2671
1536,2018-05-15 20:59:52,We love the feel and the food of a genuine 50's diner. My wife and I went to this one last night. It was just okay. Not even quite okay but just BLAH. I ordered the sliders. Here's my opinion folks for what it is worth: Whenever I have ordered sliders ANYWHERE in the country the sliders have always come THREE to an order. This one was only two small burgers with a mountain of fries to compensate. The fries were good don't get me wrong. The sliders were okay. There was only meat and cheese on them. The onions and tomato were on the side and they were raw instead of cooked onions. Traditional sliders come with chopped grilled onions on them. Also my wife ordered a chocolate malt. It wasn't malty. It tasted more like a chocolate sunday instead of a malt. Service was just okay. We had to wait an inordinate amount of time to be served and also for our check to get out of there. Biggest complaint: It was WAY HOT in there and we had to ask to have them turn on the A/C. They turned on the ceiling fans without the A/C and we were still uncomfortable but it was somewhat bearable. I would strongly recommend that if you want the look and feel of a genuine 50's diner with food and service to match that you go elsewhere.,rz3lIB3l,1955

1542,2018-02-17 13:50:04,"I have been to BLD 4 times and I have to say it is kind of a wreck.  It is an \upscale diner\"" in a place filled with casual dining.  It is overly complicated and expensive.\n\nMy first expirience was a happy hour that didn't bring me back until a work lunch.  The sandwich then was soggy on the bottom.  A coworker had the same order as me but his serving was tiny in comparison.\n\nMy daughters and I stopped in after a bike ride recently and split some of the house potato chips (that don't seem to be on the menu).  They have a blue chees sauce and Frank's hot sauce which the server said we could get on the side.  Since my young girls don't like spicy food, we did.  The chips were good and fun but I think cheddar would be a good alternative to the blue cheese.\n\nI went back with my family to sit on the patio and have apps.  They do not have heat on the patio which one server described as \""small\"" but really isn't.\n\nWe asked our waiter for the house chips and it took several trips to the kitchen before he understood what we wanted and figured out they could make them (at first he said they were out of the sauce).    We forgot to ask for the hot sauce on the side and he didn't think to recommend it.\n\nAside from the chips we had the zucchini with red chili aioli, the house salad, calamari and bacon and parm fettuccini.\n\nThe zucchini was a decent value at $5 HH prices but the sauce seemed more like ketchup and mayo than red chili aioli.  The house salad was also a decent value and $5.50 but the the candied nuts were heavy handed and overly seasoned.  \n\nThe calamari was well done but the sause with just yellow with a bit of heat and seemed to be about $2 too much at $9.25.  It really added nothing.  Even Carraba's has a better sauce.  The fettuccini was loaded with a ridiculous amount of bacon and was outrageously priced at $14.25 for some bacon, red onion, noodles and cheese.  Cut out 70% of the bacon and take $5 off the price please.  \n\n\nWhen we left the place at 6:30pm there were only a couple of tables working and a couple of people at the bar while UB's and Oregano's was packed.  With other gems like Pitta Souvli in the area I think BLD needs to find a way to be more competitive if they want to stay in business.""",YifjfzCk,484
1543,2018-04-06 09:16:37,"Wag N' Wash is just amazing. I was a fan of the PHX location forever, and when I moved to the Dale, and then they opened a location down the street- it was a pretty great day!\n\nIf you've never been, allow me to paint a picture. They have EVERYTHING for Dogs & Cats. The big draw here is a self-wash dog wash area, where they have all the cool things you need to wash your four-legged BFF without breaking your back, or clogging your tub. Simply choose your wash level (there are three, I recommend the Ultimate, because the soap is mixed with the water and all you have to do is spray on your pup, you don't need to agitate it in) and grab an apron, and you are set. The tubs are great, awesome water pressure, and dogs really like it. While you're washing your messy mutt, relaxing music is playing and the people are so nice there. I know it sounds crazy- but it's actually really fun to wash your dog there!\n\nAfter Fido is clean- if he was good then pick out a toy! They have stuff at WNW that I guarantee you've never seen before.  Some of the toys cost a few bucks more, but you get what you pay for, and my guy still has a great lobster toy I bought FIVE years ago. Booyah!\n\nWNW also has a great dog bakery where you can get treats for your pup. My dog loves the \Pupcakes\"" which are cupcakes for dogs. They look so good, I had a friend almost not believe me they are for dogs.\n\nLastly, this place is brand new, and in immaculate condition. The staff is very nice and welcoming, and the place just has a great vibe. For the times you don't feel like washing your dog- WNW offers full professional grooming at very competitive rates- your pup will be ready for doggie prom when they are done.\n\nThere is no need to shop at a chain, when you can shop at this charming, locally owned business.

1544,2018-05-08 01:42:00,"Sort of a combination of a bar/diner type of place. For cheap beer, television and maybe ok fried appetizers & sides this is an ok choice if you are in the area but if you are looking for decent food probably not, at least  based on my sandwich.  The garden veggies sandwich was basically cold bread, with a cold small mushroom that had been sauteed at some point and sliced in to 4 or 5 thin slices a with a ton of pepper sprinkled on it, a piece of cold tomato, lettuce and avocado that must have just come out of the freezer because it was a slush, I literally bit through ice. The fries as a side were ok but for an $8 sandwich it was very lacking.  \n\nCan't vouch for the rest of the menu so maybe some of the other choices are decent but the one I had makes me think whoever was \cooking\"" just throws simple things together without much thought into what they might taste like. Even a simple warming of the bread would have been nice. \n\nI hope some other people try it out to see if other parts of the menu are ok - or try the bar- they have a happy hour special before 7pm and after 10pm that includes half price drinks and appetizers.

Much better than the first one- and the first one was good, too! \n\nThe store front is bright and inviting, and the displays are gorgeous! Most ice cream-type places I go to where it's all out in a display case (Coldstone, etc) usually just have the ice cream in the container to view, which I never really thought twice about until I walked into the Gelato Spot. Every flavor they had on display had some sort of fancy garnish to go with it. The Pineapple flavored gelato had a pineapple thinly sliced into tons of pieces, and then rearranged on top. There was a chocolate-peanut butter-caramel flavor that had drizzles of caramel syrup over the top running through little pieces of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. I should have taken a picture, because those explanations certainly don't do the artistic-ness of it any justice at all. Simply put, however...beautiful.\n\nThe flavors of the gelato were outstanding. Based on my limited experience and from what I've heard other people say, gelato tends to have a more intense flavor, which isn't always a good thing. The Gelato Spot has it down to perfection. Definitely creamier and richer than ice cream with out being too intense. \n\nThe service was awesome, too. The guy behind the counter was super nice and helpful while my friend and I asked for different samples, and then at check out he gave us a bigger discount than I deserved! (TIP: I don't know if it runs every day, but I \Checked In\"" with the Yelp! app, and it saved me 10%!)  When I paid with my debit card I noticed a line for a tip amount, which I thought was strange for a place like that but I was more than happy to oblige if he really got the money. I asked if he really gets tips (but not as tacky as that sounds...), and he said \""No, cash only tips\"" and then pointed to a tip jar that said \""Support Our Troops\"". When I asked if he was serious (again...not as tacky as I sound :-/...) he said something along the lines of \""Yeah, I don't need the money as much as they do\"".\n\nMaybe it's all a scam and he pockets the money in the jar at the end of the night, but he seemed pretty sincere.

Well, their happy hour menu is to die for. They have half-price sushi and rotating drink special EVERY night. They also have reverse happy hour Mon-Thurs, which is fantastic. Their menu is extensive and has a picture book companion, which works out really well when I bring friends who don't partake in sushi often. \n\nI will say that I only partake in the veggie sushi and mock crab, but even with this limitation I always have enough to eat and they are very good about making certain rolls veggie for me.

Again, it used to be better when I first started coming, but it's still worth the half-price. \n\nNow what doesn't work?

I will gladly be cooked up if it means I can gorge myself on fresh bread in the oven. I can think of worst ways of going (ie Mullet stampede).\n\nMy friend insisted we stop here on the way to lunch. \""Oh good, do they have coffee?\"" \""No, it is just bread.\"" \""WTF? Why not?

As we stepped in, he offered more. \""Here dear, have this yummy orange.....\"" I don't know what he said cause I just went for it. The world went away when I was eating that bread. I felt ravenous. MORE! \""Cookie?\"" YES I will take that cookie! Cranberry, chocolate chips, oatmeal, almonds, YES YES YES. I think he was ready to offer more, but I ran to the back of the storefront to look at the selection. Mmmmm....doggie treats? Breadcrumbs, crispy bread treats, etc. Smart business to use up as much of product as possible. \n\nBut then it was time to choose. The vegan asked all the hard questions which the Baker (and the Grand Master Bake Master as everyone else has stated) answered all of them. She ended up w/foccaccia, which we just nibbled on for the rest of our bike journey. I ended up with the potato garlic bread that had tons of other herbs in it, it was $6 and sliced for sandwiches for me and it smelled amazing. Everytime we went to a store or restaurant, people would ask me what smelled so good. Since I was sweaty and even Toms of Maine lavendar deodorant wasnt saving this lady, I knew it was the yummy bread.\n\nAs we left, I think Jesus/Grandpa/awesome guy who worked there wanted to stuff me more for fattening up to be tasty in their oven, but I resisted...well, not really, I bought a chocolate chip cookie. Yup, I did. And I ate it after lunch and it was RAAAAAD. Best choco-chip cookie ever. That was 75 cents of raditude. \n\nSo all the haters talking about price, so get your Sara Lee, cause I am a slave to this place. And I am not even a carb monster.""",0Ow7gaY3,1274

1589,2018-06-03 02:23:08,"\LGO\"" is great. There is the grocery and the pizzeria - if you go there for breakfast or lunch, you will have to order at the grocery and then there is self-serve seating in the pizzeria. They do not serve pizza until the evening (and then they no longer serve certain sandwiches and other breakfast/lunch items in the evening). In the evening, the pizzeria becomes more of the traditional go to the hostess to be guided to your seat sort of thing. That sort of explains the chaos/mayhem some of the other posts have alluded to that can happen in the mornings. However, I believe this particular entry is for the pizzeria, which is more dinner oriented.\n\nSome tasty dishes that I have had that I would recommend:\n\nEvil Princess Thai Chicken Salad\nGladiator Pizza\nMushroom Party Pizza (add proscuitto)\nAvocado Pizza (add proscuitto)\nFish Sandwich\nCheeseburger on english muffin\n\nThe guacamole and cheese dip thingy (it's not called that, but I'm blanking) are good too - I believe it's a three dip appetizer platter of some sort.  \n\nThe food here is really tasty. They also have some nice bottles of wine on their list (and in the grocery). Great place for a non-stuffy date or for a decent sized group of people (although probably not more than like 8) to share a bunch of pizza/apps. \n\nOne last thing: parking can be a real pain. I usually just suck it up and valet - it's free if you get it validated in the restaurant. Throw the valet person a few bucks - why not?""",dbsaRq86,3119

1591,2018-02-24 16:19:19,"In an effort to cure our weekend blues - the hubby devised a new plan.  Instead of staring @ each other all weekend we alternate weekends and plan something for us to do.  Budget of $100.   No complaining!   \n\nThis was his weekend.  I'm one of those wives that loves a surprise/hates a surprise.  With that in mind I had great anxiety over the adventure ahead of me.  We start off with major construction going on our off ramp.  So we got a little side tracked and wound up going through some stranger parts of Phoenix.  I couldn't imagine a restaurant here so I was really starting to wonder what he had planned.  Then all of a sudden closer to the freeway there it is.  The most glorious signage I had ever seen.  Bobby Q's.  Fantastic.  He's gonna feed me and then the night will really begin. \n\nWe head into the restaurant and everything is so cute.  It helped so much that tonight we could finally WANT to eat outdoors if we wanted to.  It's so much cooler.  We were told that it would be about five minutes.  We turned around, sat down and then our names were called.  Not bad.  I immediately notice the comfy little love seats and some of the tables.  We were not lucky enough to grab one of them but next time I tell you, my butt will be in one of them, or outside.  Tiffany came over and explained everything.  Which was great.  I love when wait staff knows their shit.  As a diet coke fanatic I will gladly let it pass that the competition is served in their restaurant.  I oped for the peach iced tea and had four more glasses after that.  At $1.75 how can you beat that.  And its not artificial tasting at all.  This was good.  Hubby had a beer that was specifically made for the restaurant.  BBQ Amber.  Good.  Went well with the meat.  Tiffany (who in my opinion is the epitome of what a wait person should be) immediately brought us some corn bread (to hold us over) and it was so good.  So GOOD.  I frosted mine like a mini cake with that butter and was all over it.  YUM.  When we put our drink order in we put an order for the Q-rolls in.  Before I was done with my first glass of iced tea - the appy was out. Think a smaller version of a taquito with beef brisket inside.  So awesome.  Good, just good!  I ordered the three meat combo (go big or go home) chicken, brisket and baby back ribs.  Chose mashed potatoes and corn as my sides.  Done and done.  Pic to follow.  I picked up a rib and it looked like the flintstone quarry.  Clean.  Not a lick of meat on it.  Where was the meat?  Oh on my plate.  It slid right off.  Not a touch of fat anywhere on it.  Melted on my mouth and was so good I was having trouble sharing.  The brisket was phenomenal.  The chicken with a touch of the spicy bbq sauce was run out on to the freeway and play good.  DELISH!  Do you get what I'm telling you here?  Hubby's meal was just as good.  Mac and cheese was great.  The corn.  O EM GEE the corn.  The little corn coins.  So cute and so damn good.  More peach iced tea.  At some point hubby used the term \meat mayonaisse\"" to describe the ribs.   He says that the fat on the ribs (which was minimal) melted in his mouth.  \n\nThe manager came over to check on us and what a doll she is.  I'm so mad that we didn't get her name.  Dear Manager - thank you again for the delish meal, the unexpected treat after and the great time we had on our date.  We will bring everyone we know there, we will suggest to everyone that they go there.  It was a real treat.  \n\nTo summarize - great place, great drinks, great service, great food, great manager, great dessert.  It will be our go to restaurant.""",E5LxqD7c,497

I expect more from a place with hand pulled noodles. They should really take the time to make their own sauces. Which more or less was a foreshadowing of things to come. The rolls themselves were good but greasy.\n\nOur drinks were brought out quickly. Boba Milk Tea for me, iced tea for my husband. (Which I later had to ask to be refilled. Yes, one more please).\n\nOur entrees soon followed. Both dishes were cheap, hot, and heaping. As with many Asian places, they provide condiments for you to customize your food. This tray had hot chili oil, vinegar, soy, and sriracha sauce.  The food itself was rather bland though.  It needed doctoring.  I wish they had added more flavor at the beginning during cooking.\n\nWe ended up taking about half of our food home. I reheated in a pan with some stir fry sauce and a little fish sauce. Much better.\n\nWe probably won't be back. I'd rather spend my money on a lot more flavor.""",4paiQVZ1,3278

So I was excited about the changes to Radio Cafe, with hope that it might crack the rotation.\n\nEverything we had was really good.  The deviled eggs are awesome. My wife enjoyed the chopped salad, with one complaint - no option to add any protein.  I loved the meatloaf, but would like more than just a piece of meat.  I suppose thats how they turned the former $18 meatloaf into the current $14 meatloaf.   We also tried several sushi rolls, and they were all excellent.\n\nDespite the quality food, the menu has a disjointed feel to it.  Its half sushi and half \american\"" dishes.  The sushi is good, but the place just doesn't  have a sushi vibe.  That leaves the other half of the menu, which I feel has limited options.  There are only three things I would consider ordering for dinner, and only one option for my slightly picky spouse.\n\nThey call it a \""bar menu,\"" which is a mistake, because I don't think people will be going there for a drink and a quick snack.  That puts them into competition with Postino.  I would prefer more casual dining options. I think a slight redo of the former menu, with some lower priced options in addition to the entrees, would have been better.  \n\nThe building is great, all the windows were open, and now the bar opens up to the back patio.  \n\nService was so-so.  I don't expect someone to fold my napkin everytime I go to the restroom or speak with a french accent, I just appreciate some attentiveness.  Check back with the table occasionally and I'm happy.\n\nSo, with some quality additions to the menu, I think Radio Cafe would attract more repeat customers and bump up their Yelp stars.""",J353loXG,1769

She would say subtle things to make us feel like we were not ordering enough, such as \""that's it! just one dessert?,\"" \""any other appetizer?,\"" \""are you sure you don't want a sangria?\"" These weren't said with a smile either.

From the street, it looks like a dive but when you get in there, it is pretty cool.  We sat downstairs at the bar.  It's pretty dark in there.  There were (3) menus to choose from; too many choices made it hard to decide.  We were there around 11:30 so we decided to split a couple of different items to try more things.\nWe ordered a combo plate of one eggs benedict with jalapeno sauce and the meat was this slice of heaven, I mean pork loin roast.  It was fabulous.  It also came with two blue corn tortilla chicken enchiladas in a green chile sauce - yummy.  We also had the philly cheese steak - the steak was ok - lacked a bit of flavor and the cheese was non existent but the fries were the skinny crispy ones and they were delicious.  The bartender seemed a bit dull and unhelpful.  We were asking her what her favorites on the menu were (we love when the wait staff rave about the food and talk about the ingredients in expressive detail) and she said, \everything\"".  We were left to our own to decide but we did pretty good.  \n\nWe checked out the upstairs and it looked pretty cool.  \n\nThis is New Mexico food, which is different than traditional mexican food.

I tried the coffee in the lobby, and it tasted bitter and old; since it's been mighty warm out, I saw the iced tea and lemonade dispensers, made a bee-line for em, and they were empty! If that's the case, they should really store those away when not in use.\n\nThere is a pool, hot tub, fitness center, and a washer/dryer on every floor.\n\nIt'd been a long-ass day working and traveling, and by the time I rolled in, it was about 11 pm. Anna greeted me, though she wasn't working too hard at putting a customer service smile on her face. In fact, she seemed kind of snooty, and didn't say much at all. \n\nInternally, I shrugged it off; she told me where to sign, circled the space on the paper where I was supposed to write my license number. I started to say that I didn't have it memorized, but she interrupted me (as I was looking down at the paper), and said, \Right there.\"" \n\nTired, I had no idea what she was talking about, hesitated, and looked at her, and she said it again- \""ugh. right THERE. on your KEY.\"" It never occurred to me to check my key fob, of course.\n\nAs you're reading this, it sounds really trivial, but you should have been there - it was the tone of her voice. Sorry, I'm traveling, and paying to stay at your establishment, which is indirectly paying your salary! ...I don't need to feel stupid on top of that.\n\nWhen I went online to make the reservation, all they had was a room with two queen beds, and I called them to see if they had rooms with only one bed, and they switched it out to a suite - which has a frig, microwave, couch, two TVs, etc. Note that both the sofa and the bed were way too firm, and uncomfortable.\n\nBecause of Anna, what would've been 4-stars is now 3-star.""",QHTQvh8y,2001

For this reason, i'm really trying to resist the temptation to review a spot after just one visit.  This weekend i hit Beckett's for the third time.\n\nEveryone is raving about Beckett's and with fair reason, it's pretty good.  But let's drill down a bit further and see if it's really all it's cracked up to be.  \n\nApps: \n* Brussels Sprouts are good, but i think it's just a trendy item to toss onto your menu these days.  \n* The enchiladas are alright, but they don't \wow\"" anyone.  let's face it... this just isn't the place for enchiladas in the PHX.  \n* What is wrong with this: \""beckett's original grilled cheese with pancetta (aka bacon)\""  [Hint: \""aka\""] Pancetta is not Bacon.  Pancetta, like bacon, is also made from pork belly,  But pancetta is rolled and cured, bacon is smoked. The flavor is decidedly different.  \n\nMains:\n* The short ribs are great... but then again, i never met a short rib that i didnt like.  I'm a sucker for short ribs on a menu.  \n* Chicken & Dumplings... major let down.  (They were out of short ribs, so i asked the server for a reco.)  Dumplings were pretty uneventful.  Chicken was tender, but dude... its chicken.  \n*  Tasted the Osso Buco and it was pretty tasty.  \n\nCocktails and Beer:\nDrinks are well poured and fairly inventive.  Not too shabby.\nBeer list is so so... some 4peaks and a Stella.  nothing really exciting.  \n\nDessert:\ni *love* the hot/cold combo, so i'll practically make love to anything \""a la mode\""   ....naturally the poached pear & blueberry cobbler with ice cream was on my list.   It was about 6000 degrees and you couldnt really taste it.  Also, the icecream was tiny and you need more for the cobbler.\n\nHowever, the chocolate covered bacon (note: not pancetta, so they clearly know the difference, they just think you are dumb when you read the apps menu.) and PB s'mores were to die for!  \n\nSeriously... this desert is creative, delicious and hands down the best $5 you'll spend all night.  \n\nBottom line is... Beckett's is pretty good grub, nice ambiance (for a strip mall) and a pretty good menu.  The food isnt amaaaaaaaazing, but it's worth checking out.  If you do anything, come for the s'mores.  \n\n3.6 stars.... okay fiiiiiiiine... 4.""",Zw3WxuNf,1620

There's a bar up front near the entrance and there's tables as the room wraps around the corner.  Most of the seating is in an area that is incredibly dark.  Too dark for me so I ventured back to the bar area where there was more light.  Very unusual but interesting none the less.  The decor was different too: puffy stools and benches at low seated tables.  It had an oriental feel almost.  The beer selection was impressive and they even have a cinema to screen flicks.  \n\nFilmBar is a very cool place.

And it's always served really good and hot.\n\nHot & Sour Soup also has a number of distinguishable flavors floating around in it.  (As opposed to the too-thick salty goop many places pass off as Hot & Sour.)  The sour (vinegar) is always perfect.  I always order it without pork but no one else at the table seems to care because the deliciousness is nevertheless quite potent!

They seat us (2 top) right next to the in and out of the kitchen. I look around and see plenty of open tables so I'm not sure why this was the logical place to seat us. \n\nI sit down and practically slide under the table because the seat is not bolted to the wood frame. So the bench cushion which is vinyl would slip .... hard to explain but it was annoying. On the first slip I put my hand on the table to catch myself only to feel something squishy under it. When I lifted my hand off the top of the table I had the last guests rice on it. Gross!\n\nWe order drinks...the same way we always do. Loud and clear 2 iced teas NO lemon. No lemon please. She said ok no problem. She comes back a bit later with 2 good sized iced teas with a beautiful slice of lemon on each. Really? That is usually my first indication of bad service. It rarely happens but if it does I know it's going to be interesting at best. \n\nI couldn't find anything to order (Not the menu it was me) so I ordered some sweet potato fries. My husband ordered a bacon cheeseburger. I asked if my fries could be brought out asap as I was starving (again not them me). \n\nMy fries were brought out and they were hot...which is nice. That is where nice ended as they had a burnt taste to them. Not so good. \n\nMy husbands burger came out and I will upload the picture. I am all for a little pink in the middle of the burger but I am not down with a light sear on the patty. I have never seen such an under cooked burger in my life. I did nibble the edge and what I got was very good but it was not safe to eat the whole thing. So we asked for our check and bolted. \n\nThe other annoying thing is the valet parking. It is the dumbest thing I have ever seen. The parking is plenty there and you literally hand a guy a ticket to grab your car 5 - 10 feet away. I am all for job creation but this is just annoying. \n\nI will not be back,hiBj9o67,2075

About an hour and a half into todays flight It turns out that the seatbelt light happened to be on when I rang the bell for service.   The captain stated that we may be hitting some turbulence about 20 minutes earlier which is totally understandable.   I wanted to get a cup of coffee.  The attendant that came to the answer informed me that i am not supposed to ring the bell for the attendant when the seatbelt lights were on and because of that she is unable to get me that coffee.  The way that she portrayed this publically made me feel like i did something wrong.  I happily stated that i understand and would love a cup when the light goes off.  She then turned around without saying anything and went back to the front of the plane.  The guy next to me on the left questioned me saying that he wondered why the seatbelt light was still on due to the fact that we did not hit any turbulence and this was one of the most comfortable / non-turbulent flights that I have been on to Arizona.  I travel here 6-8 times a year.  I thought of this being strange as well but I decided to wait patiently.  I then later got up to go to the bathroom after seeing others go and the seatbelt light was still on.  When i arrived at the bathrooms it seemed to me that everything was pretty low key.  So low key that through the screen i could see the attendants relaxing which is completely fine with me.   Now i can totally understand a Captain giving his attendants some well deserved downtime with the seatbelt light on but this light was on for the whole duration of this smooth flight.   After I got back to my seat I realized shortly afterwords that the attendant was serving business class drinks and did nothing to get me what i had requested.  This made me feel pretty neglected due to the fact that i did nothing wrong and did not deserve to be treated in such a fashion.    This treatment made me feel like I was a nuisance to the crew.

I started with the gazpacho, which I'm not sure is Mexican at all but it's actually interesting they have it because for such a hot state, it should be more popular (R.I.P. The Other Place for their gazpacho).  Los Olivos version was oily, and really nothing about the vegetables seemed that fresh.  I got the feeling it had been \marinading\"" since maybe yesterday.  Blah, bad choice.  I remember ordering fish tacos last year and pretty much not eating them, because not only was the fish not fried, it was lacking in pretty much any discernible flavor.  The chips and salsa to start, I give them credit for - that's the highlight.  So maybe this is also a good place to go for a XX amber draft and chips and salsa.  Interestingly enough, most everyone else seemed happy with their chicken chimis and their beans/rice.  Well, they're not writing this review.\n\nService is friendly and pretty efficient.  We had a huge table with four kids and they were pretty smooth all around.  They also didn't seem to mind doing the cake service at all, which is always a plus.  Probably why there are a lot of birthdays here.  \n\nStrictly food-wise, this would be near my last choices in town for Mexican food.  But if it keeps my niece happy, I'll stick with tradition and come back next year.  As soon as she turns 18...I'm bowing out.""",BaQ5od4n,115

1658,2018-05-02 19:37:38,"I'm going to go against the *grain* here and say that I hate this new artisan bread movement. I miss the days when bakeries made warm fresh soft bread composed mostly of butter and white flour. I blame Atkins and his \fuck you, bread\"" campaign... it's not like America is any less fat today for all his efforts. \n\nWildflower is pretty much another one of those artisan bread bakeries... dry, stale tasting, and mostly crust. Given that, I'm not partial to their sandwiches. I thought I'd like their grilled cheese, but once I was done gnawing on my fried sea sponge oozing with oily cheddar, I realized I was wrong. If I could sum up their sandwiches in one word, that word would be \""dry\"" - but I could easily think of a dozen others that would be suitable substitutes, and none of them are flattering. \n\nAside from that, they have awesome salads and pasta and you can't really beat the price for what you get. I think they have good ingredients and for these reasons alone, this place would get 4 stars... they lose half a star (which is why I dropped them down to 3) because their tables are always filthy and covered with someone's dirty plates. 90% of the times I've been here, I've had to clear my own tables. \n\nMost people are huge fans of Wildflower and I do like it...

Every bite that went into my mouth was exquisite. I would drive all the way from LA just to eat at Binkley's. \n\nSo unassuming from the outside, but what a pleasant suprise inside. The staff is extremely friendly and all well-versed in the menu and ingredients in each dish. I highly recommend doing the 4-, 5- or 6-course meal. It's not going to be a budget evening, but honestly, well-worth every penny. I am salivating just thinking about it! In addition to your course (highly recommend the steak tartare, scallops, duck, - but the menu changes frequently), you are presented with at least eight amuse bouchers (\treats from the chef\"") throughout the course of your meal. Oh. My. Gosh. It's amazing how in one bite you taste so many delicious flavorfuls meld together in your mouth and create this to-die-for taste! A few examples... blue cheese froth with homemade beef jerky rested on an endive leaf, potato soup with white truffle flakes and chives, homemade Italian salami with dates on a homemade sweet potato chip, deviled quail egg, etc. I can't even begin to describe the tastes... \n\nI highly HIGLY recommend Binkley's for an amazing food experience.

I normally wear shorts and a t-shirt, or workout pants and a football jersey to church.  I always feel comfortable here.  \n\nYou may not be a Christian, and you may not consider yourself the best of people.  This place will be welcoming to you.  It's a great place to link with the community and meet people.  You can blend in alone in a large sunday service like I do sometimes, and worship God/hang out quietly.  Or you can link up with family/friends/strangers, and raise your hands in the air like you just don't care concert style!  Plenty of event choices from larger scale to small group meetings.  \n\nCounseling options include an immediate free general intake counseling session that will provide you with non-judgmental listening and feedback, and refer you to appropriate subsequent action such as counseling or materials.\n\nAt church services they often give out krispy kreme donuts and coffee for free!  The church also includes one of the nicest cafe's in Surprise, great food/drink options at very reasonable prices.\n\nThe sermons are 25 to 30 minutes, and include plenty of entertaining stories and jokes.  Pastor Lee's comedic timing is as good as Jay Leno or any other pro comedian I've seen.  A very warm, friendly, charismatic guy that possibly cries a little too often during sermons (his heart is honest and definitely devoted to people), but also definitely has an underlying \tough\"" guy edge.\n\nThe music is modern, and blends between slow heartfelt ballads to just completely rocking.  The performance is on a professional, star level.  No joke.  It's almost always like being at a very good concert.\n\nThis is a Bible based, non-denominational Christian church.  Some conservative characters may find the church too liberal.  I'm a fairly conservative person myself, and this church is liberal in areas that line up with God's word.  I feel strongly it is not liberal where it shouldn't be.  For example, inappropriate attire (such as wearing a bikini) would not be judged, but dealt with as in any other public realm legally.  \n\nIf you want to dress up in a suit, sit down during songs, and not sing- then no problem.  Highly conservatives are welcome too.  But if you want to listen to pipe organ music, mumble hymns from 1842, and listen to 3 hour sermons then this church isn't for you (not that there's anything wrong with that).  \n\nI find the church to be very Biblical grounded in serving, loving one another, and adhering to God's word.\n\nI hope to become more involved in the church, along with my family.  If you're ever looking to visit or looking to get more involved, holler @ me and we'll go for it together.  \n\nThe kids care is on another level.  Grouped by age and a label.  Such as 6 to 12 month crawlers, or 18 month to 24 month walkers.  The care is so good, I won't even get into details. My favorite part is the large windows in each care area where I can watch, but the kids can't see me.  So cool!\n\nI've listened to around 50 of Pastor Lee's sermons live or on mp3 available at the website.  \n\nwww.radiantchurch.com""",d36hGJ7V,4251

No shit!\n\nAfter 2 years of spending far more time at the TT than my own home, my doctor told me that I had to seriously consider cutting back.\n\nPeople all call this a dive bar, but I tend to think of it as a neighborhood bar. During days and early evenings, this place is mostly haunted by a cast of regulars who are mostly regular Joes and Janes. Most of them are so familiar with each other that the cross-bar banter is usually filled with venomous affection and it's almost always hilarious.\n\nOn weekend nights, the forecast at the Casa Camino is often partly Douchy, with a chance of ass-clown and stupid muff, but if one gets in early and secures a seat on the back side of the bar, it's not a bad place to people watch on a Saturday night.\n\nThe bartenders are all pretty swell and you're likely to see them amongst the common alcoholics at the TT when they aren't working. They pour a solid drink, without going over the top, and they keep the cans of Old Style fresh on the bar in front of you.\n\nWhen they are working they do tend to take their jobs seriously and are usually good at at getting the obnoxious drunks out of the place when they start bothering other customers. On busy night, there's usually a door person to help them with the task.\n\nOne cannot speak of the TT Roadhouse without mentioning the juke box. I've met people in other states that ask about the place with the great juke box when I mention that I'm from Phoenix. It's about half old-school punk, rounded off with country, rock-n-roll, funk, and some other prize finds. If you're new to the TT... PLEASE DON'T GO IN THERE AND PLAY THE 3 PUNK ROCK SONGS YOU KNOW! You'll hear them plenty while you're there. If you are a music geek, go in and pick some gems to put some variety in the mix.\n\nThe \TT\"" in TT Roadhouse refers to the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy, a 100 year old motorcycle road race held on a small island off the coast of Britain. As such, much of the decorations in the bar are motorcycle related... I first found out about the TT from motorcycling friends, but it's far from a \""biker bar\"". Tuesdays however are Bike Night, and you're likely to see a mis-mash of European and Japanese sport bikes, cafe-racers, rat bikes, and the requisite American V-twins in the parking lot.\n\nIf pedal power is more your thing, Mondays are bicycle nights, with drink specials if you show up on your push bike. (Think cruiser bikes... If you show up on your carbon road bike, resplendent in your day-glo lycra, expect a full course of well deserved ridicule)\n\nTT also now has a smoking patio out back for those that REALLY embrace their vices, but a lot of folks still congregate in the parking lot out front for their nicotine fix.\n\nOne of the best kept secrets in Scottsdale is the TTR Bloody Mary. If you've got nothing better to do with your weekend, swing by on a Sunday morning for the best bloody Bloody in town. \n\nThat's what I do... Liver doctors be damned!""",6ucuuUUc,2527

But if you enjoy real asian/thai flavors handled by a really talented chef - this is the best in Phoenix by far. \n\nAlas, many of the Phoenix transplants won't get it at first. They'll be looking for sake-bombers and will undoubtedly complain about the heat (in the food, not the weather). \n\nThe balance of flavors - sweet, salt, hot and sour - is amazing and perfect. Presentation is cool and our server knew the dishes well, and more importantly showed enthusiasm for the menu and wine list - not bad for a student from MN.\n\nWe'd never met the chef, Johnny Chu before last night, but had read years of great reviews from his work at Fate and now Sens. He visited our table throughout the evening and took time to explain each dish we had questions about. He really knows his stuff and was happy to share his passion for the flavors and technique.\n\nThe Tapas portions were ample - nearly meal sized. With so much flavor the \beverages\"" seem to go quick. Careful - the Japanese vodkas pack a punch - even though they taste more sake-like. If Sens has fresh Salmon for the fryer - it's amazing. Order the hot and sour soup and you'll want more soba noodles for the broth. We did and it was incredible. A special was 5-spice Tofu with wasabi - probably my favorite of the evening (but admittedly I'm partial to the Chinese 5-spice flavors). \n\nIf you love real Thai flavors and balance, a bit of urban cool, and know that good sake doesn't get dropped in a beer - you should check out Sens.

My father used to tease me that I was \born with a spoon of Rosita's refried beans in my mouth;\"" I have been eating here for 40 years, and the waitress I remember from my childhood still works here.\n\nFrom their humble beginnings on Buckeye road to their \""new\"" (they've been here quite awhile) location on McDowell Rd near 24th street, the owners of this restaurant have won more accolades for delicious home-cooked Mexican food than anywhere else in the Valley of the Sun. The huge portions of food are cheap and consistently delicious, based on family recipes. You're likely to encounter a live mariachi band on weekends. \n\nThe red sauce is hotter than the green, but not by much - they'll both smoke your brains out of your skull. Everything is good. Keep returning until you've tried all of it. My favorites: chile relleno with rice, beans & flour tortilla, albondigas soup, carnitas plate, and the refried beans in general.\n\nMaybe it's because I've been dining at Rosita's Place regularly for my whole life, and they know me, but I never get slow service as has been mentioned in other reviews. Also, if you think this place is in the ghetto, and you don't like that you have to park in back where you can't see your car while you eat, you're too sheltered - in case you didn't notice, there is always a paid attendant keeping an eye on the parking lot!""",tiHPYL5g,4282

1703,2018-05-28 03:58:08,"After seeing this place getting glowing reviews from the show \Check Please\"", I decided to try it.  And I am sorry I did...  After sitting down at the bar, I asked if they could turn the tv on above the bar.  The bartender explained they were all out of order - ok, bad start... So I sat down next to a couple loud yuppies at the bar - who were obviously trying to let everyone know they were extremely successful... It was not working, boneheads...  Decided to order the BLT burger, which looked good on the tv show review.  The burger arrived on a skewer, about 8 inches high a nice thick tomato, lettuce, and onion making it stand that verticle. For presentation purpose, it is kind of neat looking.  But when you try to eat it, it is another story...  There is NO WAY you can get your mouth around this burger to eat it.  They onion was not cooked enough, and was so thick, you could not even bite thru it - it pulled out when I tried and I had to re-assemble... The bun was cold - it could have used a little toasting to hold it together. It eventally fell apart again - even when I mashed it down.  I ordered the burger medium, and it came well done, NO pink - it was defintiely over cooked.  No juices at all.  The Grind advertise the ultra hot oven - and cooking it in butter on a cast iron skillet adds flavor.  BUT, I have to say, there was basically NO flavor what so ever in the hamburger meat.  It was very bland.   The bacon on the burger was nicely cooked and was tasty, but the patty was not.  It could have definitely used at least some salt and pepper.    And if there were any around (there was not), I would have used some.... The so called char from the broiler did not add any flavor - more like burned fat - yuck...   I was quite dissapointed.  I will not return.  The burger was $12, and included NO fries, that would be extra... So wih my corona and my tip, I spent about $20 total.  I would have been happier driving thru McDonalds!   I kid you not, try the double double ANIMAL STYLE at in-n-out - it is 100% tastier than this place.  The burger at coach & willies also blows this place away.  For a place that specializes in burgers, and advertises that they have won awards for them, I was expecting to be wow-ed.  Instead, I was very disappointed.""",eFXh4Y7Z,2674

Why is it that Spanish food is so yummy (completely biased here, I'm from Spain) and so cheap in Spain, and Arizona can't seem to manage to get one single Spanish restaurant right.  Oh, why?  Why am I being charged $13 for 3, yes, I said, 3 scallops.  But ok, enough about the prices which get my blood boiling.

1705,2018-05-13 17:07:04,"Love the Chicken Crispers!  The staff is always friendly and fast.  My stories make the restaurant not just a place to eat food, but a destination and hangout.  Additionally, it's a great place for a date.\n\nThe only Chili's date I've ever had was in October 2005 at lunchtime with Shauna.  The date went well although not exceptionally well.  The highlight was at the end in the parking lot.  She told me she liked my Pro-Bush policy sticker on my car thinking it was funny (Yes, I still liked President Bush in 2005, but by 2008, I realized Bush was mostly a failure.  However, I still support that particular policy today).  I told her that I was nervous about mentioning politics because I figured you might be a liberal.  The parking lot was the best part of the date.\n\nI'd like to have an even better date story at Chili's in 2010 with Aubrey; we just had our third date tonight, which went very well and seems to be a bidding relationship.\n\nAnother memory of Chili's was also in Fall 2005 while at ASU.  I would hang out with friends from my major between my afternoon and walk to my evening class next door in the Design Building.   An El Presidente Margarita or two made my Environmental Planning class much more interesting.\n\nOne day in September 2005, one month before the Shauna date, I told the server, Angela, \Has anyone told you that you look like Lindsay Lohan?\""\n\nShe smiled saying, \""Yes, I get that all the time.\""\n\nWittingly, I had the perfect response.  \""Except your more pretty than her.\""\n\nBlushing, she said, \""Thanks, that is so sweet of you.\""\n\nMy friends said that I had major guts.  We all left to go to our environmental planning class, but the story does not end there.\n\nThe night class was practically next door to the Chili's.  For the first 30 minutes of class, we met our groups.  I told the group that I had to use the restroom, but I actually ran back to Chili's.  I had an ingenious plan.  I ran back in and dropped my CPS unit on the ground where I was sitting.  \n\nWhen Angela came out, I told her, \""I came back because I left my CPS unit here.\"" \n \nShe said, \""I'll go back and look in lost and found.\""\n  \nAfter she went to lost and found, I picked it up, and she came back about three minutes later.  I said, \""Oh, never mind, I found it.\""\n  \nShe said, \""Usually, they are really good about retrieving left items.\""\n\nI said, \""Hey, Angela, you seem really cool.  Do you want to get coffee sometime?\""\n  \nOf course it was the same old story, \""I have a boyfriend.\""\n\nAnd I said, \""I didn't know, but it was worth a try, right?\""\n\nShe totally agreed.  \n\nThe conclusion to draw from my story is that somehow I graduated Magna Cum Laude from ASU in May 2006 after leaving class and pulling a stunt like that.""",ESMObcRW,393

1709,2018-01-08 21:34:04,"First off, ignore the review from Jen S. 1/19/2011, as it doesn't fall in with other reviewers & we have stayed here 3 summers for the week each time. Canyon Villas is beautiful inside & out & very clean.  If you ever have a problem call to report it & they will fix it quickly.  Hispanic maids at hotels never seem to report stuff like clogged drains or leaky faucets, etc.(in my experience).  Marriott service is amazing. Yes, they do have a cowboy singer who is at the firepit for about an hour so, who plays a guitar, but you don't have to sign along, & it is not a detriment.  This resort is not for old people, or hokey in the least.  It is beautiful with multiple pools on site (as well as those you can use at the adjacent Marriott JW Hotel).  The rooms at the hotel are smaller & no kitchen/washer dryer, etc.  If you like to cook your own meals, like having a balcony with table/chairs, dishwasher, & all amenities, incl. granite counters throughout, then the Villas are for you.  They can be rented by the night using Marriott reservations number or www.marriott.com.  Select Marriott Vacation Club for the search by hotel type & enter Phoenix.  There are now DVD players in every room, the \studio\"" (lockoff unit), the 1 bedroom master & the living room.  These 3 components equal a 2 bedroom, 2 bath unit.  You can rent 2 bedroom as stated, or just the studio with mini kitchen (small fridge, microwave), living room, sleeper sofa & king bed, full bathroom.  The 1 bedroom is the master unit with separate bedroom, bathroom with large shower, sink & toilet, plus a large soaking tub & 2nd sink.  Living room also has a dining table that sits 6 people with included chairs.  Marriott is upgrading sleeper sofas in all units when they come up for renovations to a new type that was tested at Marriott Villas Mountainside Park City Utah.  They are made by American Leather & are memory foam mattresses that fold out & are much, much better than the existing standard metal frame & lumpy old mattresses.   No telling when all locations will have them.   There is a special kids pool area at the north end of the Villas resort.  It has sprayers in the concrete, etc.  There is also a separate playground area between some of the buildings at the north end.  Each building is 3 stories high & each building has an elevator.  Generally these units are pretty quiet in my experience.  I have found the Canyon Villas to have a very good maid staff & they are very clean.  We usually trade our week for a week each year at Canyon Villas because we love it.  I love the desert & the landscaping & wildlife at Canyon Villas is just beautiful.  There is a free shuttle to the JW each hour & they go to Desert Ridge Shopping Center every 2 hours on the even hour.  Desert Ridge has BJ's Brewpub, Barnes & Noble, Dave & Busters entertainment,a large movie theatre, Kohls, & numerous other large restaurants & shopping.  You also get your groceries to stock the villa there at Albertsons (a great market).    We always can't wait to go back every year.   There is lots to do if you want to venture out, like the Phoenix Art Museum, Bot. Gardens, Zoo, Arizona Rock & Mineral Museum, visit the State Capital building, etc.  There is Wildfire Golf Course on one side of the property & another amazing Golf course on the other side.   Oh, the beds are the same as in the JW, firm, but have a pillow topper on them.  Super comfortable always!  Also, as the units are updated, they are going to have all stainless steel appliances.   If you do the highly recommended Marriott tour, you will see the updated unit they use for showing.  Marriott is a great company & timeshare tours are not high pressure.  It is a great product & well worth buying into.  They no longer sell weeks, just points & you no longer are tied to a home resort.  You can use your points annually for where ever you want to stay.  You buy a point value & still pay maint. fees based on the point value you buy.""",J7sgFUNR,2989

We got home with the pizza's and bread stick  EUCKKKKKKKK the pizza was doughy  the sauce had a horrible taste to it..

1724,2018-04-25 12:39:05,"Good. Not spectacular.\n\nMy 3 stars may be a consequence of so thoroughly enjoying central Phoenix's other top destinations, as you can see if you peruse my other often 5-star reviews. My expectations were high for Milano, given the standards set by its mid/downtown brethren like Postino, Bianco, Fate et al. But while I enjoyed the Milano experience, the x factor was just not there for me. \n\nWhen it comes to atmosphere \coziness\"" is an important factor for me, if that makes any sense, and the owners of Milano have clearly sacrificed that for the sake of sheer size. More tables and chairs means more revenues, after all. Since the owners, LGO Hospitality, have been so successful in their other endeavors I can understand the temptation. But the interior is so vast that it skirts on the edge of seeming cafetaria-like, albeit a very hip, chic cafetaria. It almost reminded me of so many of Scottsdale's massive destination restaurants, which are often national chains. It's not quite as bad as those mass-volume food factories, but like I said, it flirts with them.\n\nThe service was a bit annoying. Our waitress was trying to be friendly and efficient, but she still managed to screw up almost everything we ordered from start to finish. When we ordered a couple of beers, she told us they were having some problem with our particular selection so it would take a couple minutes to get them to us. She came back 5 minutes later with some additional explanation for more delay. When she came back 5 minutes later with yet another explanation we told her we'd rather just order a different beer and that it was no big deal. She didn't seem very concerned about the fact that we'd now been seated for 10-15 minutes without getting desired beers in our hands. Our beers finally arrived, and we gradually drank and enjoyed them, and ordered a 2nd round. At which point she told us that what we'd just drank was not what we ordered, it was actually the first beer selection we'd made, but we got the last two glasses of it, so only now would she bring out our second selection. Again, all of this is no big deal and we really didn't care about the confusion (except for the delay), but the very fact I'm spending 5 minutes explaining it in a review instead of focusing on how cool the place was is Milano's problem, not mine. \n\nOne of my friends who had ordered wine was very irritated about finishing one glass and not getting a refill without, again, a pretty long delay. Perhaps she was a victim of the size-over-coziness syndrome I describe above. \n\nWe were a party of 3, and we ordered 3 larger dishes that we intended to share, along with 2 smaller appetizers to start with. Total confusion reigned over the process of getting these to us. The 3 main dishes arrived one at a time and only after we'd finished the prior one. She actually forgot about the 3rd one. She was asking us if we wanted dessert while we were still waiting for the 3rd dish, only adding to our growing sense of irritation. \n\nHere's the kicker. When all was said and done, our waitress brought us a free dessert, with her apologies for the late wine and the beer confusion. We enjoyed it and were very grateful and appreciative. And I still am. Then this happened: one of my friends wanted change for a 20, to make it easier to pay the $3 valet charge outside. We first waited ten minutes or so just to get our waitress's attention after we had already paid (and handsomely tipped) her on a $97 bill. When we finally got her and my friend asked her to break the 20, she cheerily and politely told him to just get change from the valet, because it would take too long for her to (walk 20 feet across the restaurant and) get the change from the bartender. \n\nTalk about a buzz-killer. \n\nI commented to my friends as we walked out that she'd already been tipped so why bother going out of her way for us now? Not exactly what you'd expect from a top-notch eatery that values its customers, is it? \n\nOh, and the food? It was fantastic. Everything we ordered was unique, fresh, very tasty and we loved it. Isn't it a pity that I could only get around to describing it here after getting the multitude of other problems we had to deal with out of the way first? If I were the executive chef, I would be very, very angry about this review. That said, my compliments to him or her. And my sympathies.""",cW8Qfohw,4572

The guest of honor was a visiting NYC foodie, so she was in charge of ordering.

Johnny Chu has a way with tofu that is purely mystical. \n\nCold duck salad- I may have to update my last meal request from my mother's albondigas to this salad \n\nWasabi tofu- again, the tofu is mastery and even though I'm not a huge fan of wasabi, my friends are \n\nSoba noodles- just solo as a side they add a great layer to the meal and the kid loved 'em!

I'm really partial to efficient, genuine service and sometimes it's pretty lackluster. \n\nAlso, the portions are generous for tapas and the price is reasonable but all those fun drinks and tasty tidbits add up, so watch out.  \n\nOverall, an amazing showcase of downtown talent and so worth the visit!""",4U5LQesK,2268

The prime rib had good flavor for breakfast not top quality but pretty good, considering we are in a diner.  This is one of their specialities and if you are hungry it's perfect. This also comes with hash browns, eggs, and two humongous cupcake sized biscuits with a well seasoned gravy. If I wasn't low carbing it that would have been lunch! \n\nThe decor is cute and quaint. The care and thoughtfulness of the staff shines thru.They talk to each customer like they are old friends and some of them were. When you are passing thru No Pho   give them a try.  They are open for  lunch and breakfast  only.""",O6YCZUnd,2443

I consider myself a happy hour expert and theirs is damn good with several top shelf options for bottom shelf prices.\n\nThey (are supposed to) open at 4:00pm.  The last time I went my wife and I showed up a few minutes early.  The door was locked but no biggie, they aren't open yet after-all, so we decided to chill and chat outside the door.  4 o'clock came and we tried again but still locked...  Whatever, its beautiful out and I have the best company in the world to wait with.  4:05.  Still locked.\n\nBy this time another couple had come by and left, not wanting to wait like us.\n\n4:10...  still locked.  Seriously?  So I decided to call almost as a joke.\n\nI did.  They picked up.  I asked what time they opened.  She girl replied happily that they opened at 4.  My next question was to ask what time it was because I was waiting outside.  I was nice about it and all.\n\nHer reply was \ummm\"", then I heard her ask someone else if the time was right on the computer, then she put me on hold.  Tic toc..., a minute or two went by and by this time we were getting a little frustrated with it now being almost 4:15.\n\nI hung up, tried the door again, still locked, so we walked away.  We got pretty far away and sat on a bench so I could consult Yelp on the next new spot and looked back to see a girl poking her head out the door.\n\nWe went back and were let in.  No \""sorry about that\"" or anything which is about all it would have taken.  We ordered our cocktails (the C.E.O.) which is supposed to be a dirty martini with Chopin, by far my fav vodka.  Its a potato vodka unlike the Belveder (also very good but not Chopin) which he used for the martinis.  Small detail but it would have been nice if he said something instead of just using a different vodka than listed on the menu.\n\nWe ordered their steak quesadilla which was awesome as usual.  \n\nI've had dinner here also and it was expensive but very good.  Place gets nuts (pretty fun crowd) at night with live bands, cougars looking for rich guys, and poor guys pretending to be rich to land a cougar.\n\n Post up at the bar and have fun.  \n\nSo I guess \""it is what it is\"".

I expected to get the same kind of response as we all have before, but I didn't.  \nBefore I could get the chance to email her back, she found my phone number in her database and called me asking me to let me know the specifics so that she could be aware of any way she can improve her business.  It's refreshing to know this website is used by business owners in a constructive way.\nAfter explaining the specifics, she apologized, promised to work with her employees on improving their customer service skills and invited me back to try a massage with another therapist and try a facial as well.  \nI applaud Kristen for emabracing growth, feedback, and education about her business.  I work with small businesses everyday and know that many are opposed to change and will shut their ears to any type of negative feedback.

Tapdancing, I get nightmares about Ted's Hot Dogs just looking at all the people lined up to eat unhealthy processed food. I had to walk a block away to the front door. \n\n2.) Nowhere to sit once you're inside. All the tables are full. I had to stand and circle the restaurant like a vulture looking for a place to sit. \n\n3.) Customer base skews elderly. I counted two - correction, three - elderly couples with walkers who needed the door held open for them. Not exaggerating. If you're under 60, you have no business eating at Culver's. But, hey, that's just me. \n\n4.) The beverage lids are apparently dispensed from this confusing doohickey thing. I'm fumbling with the doohickey trying to get the lid for my cup, and a rude (and elderly: see point #3) Culver's employee practically yells at me, \No, you do it like this-!\"" Thanks. I'll remember that if I'm ever in there again.\n\n5.) The food wasn't worth the wait. Nearly every item on the menu is a different variation of their hamburger.

Other had chicken fingers and those looked OK. \n\nAs for the adults..... \n\nAtmosphere was great. It was like a lodge when you walk into the establishment. Got there at 6pm on a Friday night and were immediately seated. Tried to get reservations before hand however they do not accept reservation after 5pm. Why I don't know...... Seems to me that if they are looking to serve a certain clientele they should accept reservations...looks like they are trying to compete with Outback restaurants - no reservations. \n\nThis is a Canadian establishment so I decided to start with a Molson in tap. I must say, it was served at a perfect temperature and definitely quenched my thirst (even had a few ice bits in the first sip). \n\nOn with the food.....My wife had Prime Rib Classic Dinner. It comes with Salad and side (onions, bell peppers and mushrooms sauteed). Wife said the Prime Rib was was a 4 out of 5. \n\nAs for myself, I had the Fillet. Which came under recommendation from the waiter. I typically go for the rib eye steak. I got the salad and sides same as the wife. I could have done without them. Not a big fan of partially cooked onions. I would have preferred them caramelized. Ordering a steak's doneness is always a crap shoot for me. It never comes out as the way I want it. On the menu it tells you the degree of doneness and decided to go with what it stinking if a restaurant has the name \""Steakhouse\"", I could not go wrong. I ordered medium. Well it came out in my opinion Medium well. Also since they cook the steak in such high heat, there is a layer of charred meet where the Fillet was touching the grill. Not my favorite. \n\nAll in all I would like to give this place another shot. As I think anyone should do. Will update this review whenever that happens...... \n\nThe waiter was attentive (almost too much). Hate trying to talk with my mouth full.

I may be a very extreme case, as I have made listening to Movin into a lifestyle.  I am an MVP listener where I score Bonus Codes at practically all the opportunities, email the DJs about Nina D's silliness or Robert's cheesehead devotion (ok i have a lot of freetime), and most even created my own spreadsheet and MP3 library at home of the itunes playlist complete with album art.\n\nThe music?  Lately, they have taken the pedal off the metal with the amt of Freestyle / Disco tunes.  But I love the dance lean & I'm always in a good mood with whatever choices the DJ makes.  Today and back in the day!  And whats more awesome, on the weekends, they alter their programming with the \double play\"" weekend where you hear tunes that you cannot hear anywhere else, only if you had a time machine or cassette tapes.\n\nThe programming?  When its a local DJ, they are great.  But I was heartbroken that they put Ryan Seacrest in syndication from the 1-4pm hour.  It was a real problem with me for the first couple days, they treated the DJ AM plane crash news like a national story of interest.  Like most people of Phoenix, I have no idea who this guy is and would rather hear about more relevant local news.  Besides mental tuneout with \""On Air\"", I love hearing the DJs interact with the listeners.  The highlight is in the morning directs many morning topics and hands out giveaways for the *most extreme* circumstance.  The creativity of various talking points make listening to Lukas & Nina's banter very entertaining.  Its definitely a huge improvement daily frustrating stale morning brain benders.\n\nInteractive with the listeners!  Since I first started listening, the station has found more ways where listeners can participate and this is more fun.  Probably the most famous is \""Pick your Purse, Choose your Shoes\"".  I fantasize about having my name called, grabbing a huge bag and tall boots and telling Nina that I am keeping them for myself.  And hopefully they will host more listener events so I can participate in person.  This year, they hosted an 80s party at Wrigley & Singles Night at Chase Field.  And most recent, they have become more involved with promoting the Phoenix Suns - my favorite NBA team!\n\nSo I will give the new Movin 97.5 a 5/5 rating.  Definitely a highlight of my week on Monday afternoon when Robert Lewis starts his slot, he reminds the listeners that the Green Bay Packers are America's team.  Win or lose, he's speaks about his pride in the Pack.  But I cannot forget after a most crushing overtime loss in the NFC championship game to the New York Giants nullifying a cheese Super Bowl in Phoenix, a party for our lifetime.  With great anticipation to hear Robert recap that game, he chose instead to promote the upcoming Hannah Montana concert.  Yes, I guess it hurt that bad!""",7CE65kZn,1183

(GHHK used to be painted pepto pink, but I think they have upgraded to sea foam green).\n\nI really like the sizzling rice soup, it's a nice change from the standards, but the wonton soup is good, and the hot and sour soup is average.  The shrimp/prawn and chicken dishes are tasty, but have been Americanized.  The live seafood options and duck are much more authentic.""",WXMPfn0Y,4293

Our waitress would disappear for long lengths of time in which we would be sitting there without refills. We had to ask for refills every time we needed one because the waitress seemed oblivious to the empty glasses we placed on the edge of the table. Unlike any Mexican restaurant that we had ever been to, they didn't provide water without us asking for it. \n\nThe food: Over priced. $15 for a Mexican pizza?! $3.99 for a small piece of Flan?! We decided to share the Adobada Pizza because we didn't feel like dropping $15+ a plate when we weren't that hungry. The Adobada Pizza was okay - not worth the price. The meat was excellent, but the toppings were skimpy.

1856,2018-05-18 23:45:12,"Ok, I'm a BBQ fan. St. Louis, Chicago, Philly, Memphis, Texas I love em all. I have often dragged my wife on BBQ treks for hundreds of miles. With that being said I have to begin by saying that Bobby Q has EXCELLENT BBQ. Tender, smoky and chock full o' flavor. I have been here multiple times and have never had anything that disappointed me...until last night. An event so treacherous and diabolical that it prevented me from rating them with 5 stars. The horror!\n\nThe in-laws were in from the East Coast and we decided to take them there for dinner. Everything was smashing and up to par as usual until dessert came. Now I have to go on record as saying that I always loved the heaping pile of scrumptious peach cobbler that they serve on the dessert menu. So much so that I convinced my table of 6 to order 3 since they are usually large enough to share and stunningly delicious. Every time I go to Bobby Q I finish off my meal with it and love to complain to my wife as I waddle out of the building (in the grand tradition of glutinous American excess) that I ate too much and my belly hurt. I was looking forward to lamenting my fate yet again last night. But alas, I was in for a shocking turn of events and was dubbed a deceitful liar by the entire table. \n\nTo my horror when the cobblers arrived, they were measly, sickly, ill-prepared portions and a pale shadow of what they were on previous visits. We were plagued with three bowls of undercooked (as in practically raw) peaches that tasted like they were straight from a can and a soggy, undercooked thin square of \crust\"" sitting on top as an afterthought.  This flavorless absurdity could only have been more demeaning if it were capable of speech and threw dated insults at us. It literally looked like they dumped half a can of uncooked peach slices in a bowl and threw a wet piece of thin white bread on top. All three servings were like this. Now on EVERY occasion in the past the cobbler was gigantic, actually was cooked and warm, had a delectable FULL crust and tasted like it came out of Gramma' Cobbler's oven fresh. To this peach cobbler bizarro universe doppelganger I spit at thee and thine preparer. Bah I say. BAH.\n\nOf course, we complained to the waitress who was nice but said she didn't know that it was any different from normal.  She went back to whoever prepared them and came back saying that the preparer said \""they're the same as they always were\"" which either proved the preparer's incompetence or their willingness to shame the establishment with a bowl full of cobbler-like lies. Our waitress even said she talked to the manager who went back to speak with the preparer...but said manager never came out to either see the imposter cobblers or speak with us about it, which rates as quite poor customer service.  Overall, it left a dark mark on an otherwise belly -bustingly deeeelicious visit. Shame on you Robert Q, shame. \n\nSo, I will still eat at Bobby Q. as their dinner fare IS fantastic (assuming there are no more obvious but blatently denied changes such as with the cobbler), the environment is cozy and the staff are (generally) quite pleasant. However,  I will be wary about ordering the dessert in the future and about the quality and integrity of their customer service skills. I would advise you to use the same caution.""",Q7k6tGOr,990

I even got the food to go, which was a surprise because most places do not do this. The two dishes I was very impressed with was the Market Street Short Rib Tacos ($6.50) and sweet potato chips ($2). The Tzatziki + Hummus + Olives + PIta was OK. I'd probably pass on that the next time I come here. Overall, the place is very nice.

The place was rediculously crowded, the wait staff was running around like it was their 1st time working at a restaurant, they had what looked like 5th-9th grade girls (owners daughters?) serving drinks and seating people.\n\n\.....hey, let's open up a restaurant, how hard can it be?  it's not rocket science....\""\n\nThere were several 10-seat tables with lazy-susan's (sorry if your name is susan) that were reserved while throngs of customers waitied for the 4-person booths and smaller tables to open up.  Meanwhile, there were 3-4 tables waiting to be cleared as the waitresses looked like they were swamped.  Bringing out 1 order what looked like every 10mins.\n\nwe reluctantly conceded to taking a booth and 2 small tables for our family of 15 all the while eyeing the 10-seat banquet style tables with hand written scraps of paper shouting \""reserved\""\n\nit took forever for them to come and take our order.  the waitress was making us nervous with her fast talking and sense of urgency to get back to serving food to the other tables.\n\nso to make it easy, we just ordered double-portions of about 10 different dishes and we never saw her again until our 1st entree came out.\n\nthe whole dinner took in excess of 2 hrs\n\n\ni remember saying that there are plenty of other places to eat with the same quantity, quality and price and much closer to east chandler where we live.\n\nfast forward to august 27th, 2010....I entered this place again with fear and trepidation.\n\nso i thought of a new strategy, have my wife who speaks fluent cantonese call in a reservation for 10 and we'll get the royal treatment.  as i listened to the jiberish dialogue, and my wife promptly hangs up the phone, i asked, \""she didn't even ask for a reservation name or phone number?\""\n\nwife:  NO\n\ngreaaaat.  it was not an official reservation i shouted!  we'll get there, and the there will be no 10-seat banquet style lazy-susan equipped table available and the hostess will look at us and say, \""what name was it under?\""\n\nso for the next 5 mile drive, i was thinking about what i was going to say when i arrived to our destination.\n\n\""....hi, were chinese and have a reservation for 10.....\""\n\n\""...reservation for 10, for the mayor of chandler..\""\n\nso when i swung open the door, the waitress/hostess greeted me with a \""how many?\"" gesture (don't ask me what that's supposed to look like) and i held up both my hands with 8 fingers and 2 thumbs outstretched.\n\nmuch to my surprise, she smiled and pointed to the 10-seat-lazy-susan.\n\nfor those of you who had a \""bad service\"" experience, i have to let you in on a little secret:\n\n this is going to sound racist, but if you don't speak the lingo, they're not gonna carry on a \""hi, how are you, and how's your family\"" conversation.  I don't speak a lick of chinese and if i were to eat here alone, they'd snuff me.\n\nsince my dutiful wife is fluent, gregarious and has a lovely demeanor, they love her and chat her up.  they make recommendations, ask her how old her daughter is, how cute it is that she can speak cantonese too.  and i'm sure they're asking why doesn't your chinese-looking husband speak chinese?  is he one of those \""slow\"" ones?\n\ni having been raised for 3 generations in AZ, used to think, \""these people really look down upon me for my ignorance\""\n\nbut i've come to realize that perhaps they just feel more comfortable speaking to someone in their native language as opposed to the semi-complicated english(?)\n\nin my 47 years of eating at 100's of different chinese restaurants, i can only count on 1 hand the few that have had great \""western style\"" service. (think PFChang, pei-wei, panda express, noodle ranch).  does that make me stop eating at chinese restaurants?  if that were the case, then i would have to avoid eating at the top 10 chinese restaurants (as far as the food, price and quantity goes) in phoenix.\n\n3 out of 4 i can live with.\n\ngood food, good quantity, bad prices, bad service.....i will go but only if someone insists on going\n\ngood food, bad quantity, bad prices, bad service (see wong's place)....if family members drag me there and are paying\n\nbad food, good quantity, good prices, good service.....no way jose\n\nyou get the picture.\n\nturns out there are as good places that are\n\n1) closer in proximity\n2) as good quality\n3) same prices\n4) same service (with wife or mom in tow)\n\nso it's not a must have place to run to\n\nif you live in chandler and awhatukee, you have my 4 stars""",HwjCqN4X,23

If I'm looking for running skirts-forget it they don't carry them. I have also been disappointed in their selection of running sports bras and they tend to run out of sizes fast as well.

1907,2018-02-02 18:03:13,"I have to say that I really enjoy eating at Sacks.  It's definitely one of my top two lunch spots for yummy quick eats.  I've sampled quite a bit of the menu and my second favorite sandwich is the O'Keefe.  It's basically chopped chicken, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, melted Swiss, avocado, lettuce, tomato and honey mustard served hot on a soft baguette.  The honey mustard gives it just enough tang to really bring out the flavor of the seasoned chicken.  My only \beef\"" with this sandwich is hot lettuce.  I'm sorry, but there are some things in this universe that were not meant to be, and lettuce being served on a hot sandwich (or on a hot Mexican food plate; more on that later) is not one of them!  \n\nMy most favorite sandwich here is the Symphony.  I like to think of it as a turkey club with a twist.  It's loaded with fresh turkey breast deli style meat, bacon, avocado, tomatoes, LOTS of alfalfa sprouts, cream cheese and mayo on wonderful 12 grain bread.  I usually hold the mayo, because that's just the kinda guy I am.  You might say, that's how I roll. But I say, I'm just not a mayo kinda guy...\n\nThe best part about lunch at Sacks is the silver dollar sized warm chocolate chip cookie you get with your sandwich.  And yes, it's been reported that the Tiki sometimes eats the cookie first, but having no photographic evidence, you can't prove it and I'll plead the 5th.  And speaking of tiki's there's a really cool Tiki at the Tutor Time just a few doors down to the north.  Check it out!\n\nOkay, I said the cookie was the best part of lunch at Sacks, but I lied.  The really super dooper best part about lunch at Sacks is the Market Spice Iced Tea.  Some days it's too weak, some days it's too strong, but on the days that it's just right, it will blow your socks off, so you might want to bring an extra pair, just to be safe!\n\nMy only dislike about Sacks is that is can get pretty loud at lunch.  It's usually crowded between 12-12:30 so I try to go early or after 1 pm.  And don't forget, you can always call ahead and take it to go!""",Vwmz6Zos,3468

Judging by the reviews, I'm not sure if they were having an off day or whether what we ordered was really a good representation of Peruvian food.\n\nWe ordered fried yuca, and the server said it would be about 15 minutes.  20 minutes later he came back and said another 15 minutes.  We never did see it.  I'm not sure if this dish required some preparation that had not been done since we were in early, but I was disappointed to not be able to try it.\n\nI had the Lomo Saltado with chicken.  The chicken was pretty dry, and the \secret sauce\"" was such a secret, it was almost hidden from my plate.  I really only tasted soy sauce.  The Peruvian style fries were underneath the chicken.  I'm not sure how they differed from regular fries though.  My husband had the Corderito Chiclayano (lamb shank).  It had a ton of flavor, but again the meat was tough.\n\nThe chef (perhaps owner too?) did come out and apologize for the yuca and was very sweet, however.

1916,2018-05-12 10:01:18,"Going out at night on Mill Ave is always an interesting experience for me.

The venue itself was decent, a stage for performers, some small tables/stools by the dancefloor, couches to the side, and an upstairs (loft) seating area as well. djSeduce was spinning phat Latin-fusion beats until the Latin-jam band neo-Primitive came on and rocked/salsa'd/mambo'd the house down. The Phoenix metro area really needs more events like this one, because there's only so many venues playing your standard mindless Top 40/hip-hop/reggeton/cheesy techno before you give up in finding something actually different. So I give props to the Loft for agreeing to host this monthly event (http://www.myspace.com/afrobaile). I just wish it was weekly, because I'd be there each and every time. Oh well. Can't win 'em all. \n\nThere was a decent-sized crowd of college kids and what looked like their professors, but I hope it picks up because the live band + dj was definitely worth it. \n\nAs for the rest of the bar, I had a drink. Bartender was friendly. And no pretentious feel at all about the place. Most of the overly done up kids outside kept walking past, probably on their way to the Library or Fat Tuesday or the other standard Mill stuff. Too bad. They don't know what they're missing. Then again, maybe they, too, will find themselves in a college town 10 years from now, looking for something \""different.\""\n\nSo cheers to you, Loft. 4 stars.""",Gbh5y4id,2995

I understand that it's made to your order like Chiptole or Qdoba, but they'll add very little cheese or toppings on your food, which can cause you to request more. To save myself time and every yelpers eyes from reading this long story, the individual making my tacos was extremely frugal on the toppings on my tacos. She barely put any cheese on my 3 tacos and I simply requested that she could put a little more on the tacos. She did and when I went to pay for my order, I was charged an extra 95 cents for \side cheese.\"" The issue isn't the money because eating at Cafe Rio can be expensive for a fast-food mexican restauant, but it's the principle of charging me extra after I said, \""can you please put a little more cheese on my taco.\"" \n\nThis hasn't been the first time this happened, but a previous visit had the same result with the sauce on my burrito. I thought mexican food restaurants had gigantic burritos and generous size tacos, but Cafe Rio will charge you on top of your order if you don't like their skinny tacos.\n\nAll I ask for from Cafe Rio to acknowledge that when you add more toppings to what the cook's add to your food, that they say, \""this will be extra.\"" They do this at Chiptole and Qdoba, but Cafe Rio would rather screw you over at the end. \n\nI will not be visiting this establishment again.

Enter: Wy-Knot Cafe. \n\nStumbled upon this place after searching online for tofu breakfast burritos. At the Wy-Knot Cafe I found tofu burritos and so, so much more than I was looking for. Not only are they vegetarian friendly, but they are happy to accommodate vegan requests as well! \n\nThe staff is incredibly friendly, and down to earth. I love that their outside seating is dog-friendly. The whole vibe is very lazy Sunday morning; the cafe is very relaxed, but nice.\n\nMy favorite is the Tofu Veggie Delight with hummus instead of the cheese spread. It's a delicious sandwich with lightly crispy tofu. I've been with friends that have tried the meat-eating flavors and they have always left satisfied! They also have great soups daily, and filling salads.\n\nThis place is a win-win for people of all dietary backgrounds.

Is not actually much of a restaurant.  It's a sports bar and they have a little bit of food, mostly wings.  Yummy crunchy spicy snacky things though.

1989,2018-02-28 16:04:22,"The Jan 5 performance of The Pajama Game was a crowd pleaser to a full house on an evening where the weather cooperated and didn't rain as had been predicted.  The play was accompanied by a seven instrument orchestra and the acting & singing were in sync to the seldom heard songs \Hernando's Hideaway\"" and \""Hey There...\"" and even less heard to \""Steam Heat\"".  The lead roles were skillfully acted throughout but with greater laughter after intermission.  Kevin Morrow was a very energetic Sid Sorokin with an excellent voice while Kelly McCormick was equally entertaining as Babe Williams as head of the grievance committee. The 7 & 1/2 cent call for a strike by the garment union was enjoyable but makes one wonder what it really should be today with the recent run-up in oil prices. There were few patrons in pajamas but there was a feel good ending with the colorful pajamas on stage to a standing ovation.  Other than almost forgetting an umbrella the only glitch we encountered was locating the car on Blue B which was actually stairwell 5 vs. trying to find it on stairwell 4 where Blue C was located.  Go Figure.\n\nI also attended the  opening night performance (Feb 7) of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and felt it was slow at first but picked up after intermission with a particularly effective shadow sequence with a cane.  The acting grew more intense and for some reason the actor playing Dr. Hyde reminded me of Richard Dryefus of Jaws fame.  Hyde had a response for every situation that seemed logical but deranged. For my taste musicals like the Pajama Game with more stage props and color are more entertaining but the acting in Jekyll and Hyde was top notch as noted in B F.'s review.  From a personal  taste point of view I would give it 2 stars and 4 stars for a clean performance yielding an overall 3.  Some of the audience stood but I wouldn't call it a standing ovation which in part could be due to the subject matter vs musicals.\n\nI remember seeing a B &W movie version growing up and in checking Amazon found at least 4 versions (1920, 1932, 1941 and 1982).  Since 1982 was color it had to be one of the others.

If you have a large party to entertain, Wong's offers a special dinner price that is all inclusive and large family-style tables so that  everyone can share.  It is not uncommon for the place to be packed with families at dinner time on the weekends.  If it is fine dining or gourmet Chinese ambiance that you are looking for, you won't find it here, BUT....I highly recommend Wong's if you are looking for a delicious neighborhood fare for a great price.""",jFTgzU5R,1215

2000,2018-06-01 00:14:44,"Heard about it through the grapevine and figured, why the heck not?  We went on a Tuesday evening just after 6pm and waited about 5 minutes to be seated.  We were seated in the VERY LAST BOOTH you could get from the conveyor belt, so that sucked rocks as everything had been picked over.  Still, food was decent.  Spicy tuna was nice and spicy, the tempura roll was still hot from the fryer and the veggie rolls were very crisp and delicious.  The cream puffs were frozen solid and never defrosted.  Didn't get to try any of the salads, but the seaweed salad looked phenomenal.  We weren't given plates to lay our chopsticks on, so we grabbed some empty ones from the conveyor belt as it was hard (being in the corner booth) to get anyone's attention.  They turned OFF the conveyor belt while we were still sitting and munching at our table so a waitress finally walked over and said that if we needed anything to go through her.  Then she disappeared, walking throughout the restaurant.  She was nice....but never came back to us, until we asked for our bill then she got a little bit snotty with *why did we take the plates off the conveyor belt*.  \n\nBecause we were never given any plates to put our chopsticks on and we didn't want to just lay them on the table or on the dirty plates.  So, they were a little miffy about it since there were drinks or snacks that we could have been charged for (but again, any *normal* person would notice there was an empty snack/soda/juice container on the table to correspond with the empty plate--duh).  \n\nI can see how this place would fill up fast and could get insanely crowded.  I just didn't like the fact that they TURNED OFF THE CONVEYOR BELT while we were still sitting and eating--that's a sure sign of them not so subtly saying \Please leave\"".  Really felt like they tried to rush the two last tables on that side of the room OUT the door so they could clean and close up that portion of the restaurant.  I didn't enjoy that.  \n\nIT was a little bit loud in there--reminded me of 90's pop rock sung in Japanese--cute, but annoying.  Definitely could have been turned WAY DOWN.""",moXXLpsK,4833
2001,2018-06-04 23:27:03,"I have been to 4 Peaks several times. Each visit has been a pleasant experience. As a casual microbrewery 4 Peaks does a good job. The handcrafted beers that I have tried are all very good. My personal favorite is the Kilt Lifter, an amber ale, similar to a Fat Tire but not nearly as sweet.  \n\nThis Friday I met some colleagues at the 4 Peaks in North Scottsdale. A friend and I decided to split the 16\ barbecue chicken pizza. This size was just right for 2 people. We both started out very hungry and still had two slices left over.\n\nI would rate the quality of the pizza below dedicated pizza joints like Bianco, Grimaldi's and Humble Pie, but above places like Peter Piper, Zipps, etc... It was about on par with something you would get from Papa Johns or Dominos, which is just fine in my book if accompanied by a really good cold beer. \n\nThe place was full and had a lively atmosphere. The only thing missing was a good college football game. With that in mind, next time I will go on a Saturday. Cheers!""",vNGuKAGh,4291

2015,2018-05-20 16:44:48,"Go for breakfast or dinner (after 3). Lunches are lacking. I ordered their Chopped Salad (which is a knockoff of the Stetson salad from Cowboy Chiao). I've had it before and it was pretty good. This time, they served it without 2 main ingredients which is pretty apparent if you're familiar with the Stetson's signature \rows\"" of ingredients. I pointed it out and they said those ingredients were out and offered me a cookie to compensate. If you know the salad is incomplete don't let customers pay $7.99 for it with the hopes they won't notice or be too shy to speak up. With so many great options in the Scottsdale Airpark area, I doubt I'll ever be back. Sad\n\nOh, by the way, Cowboy Chiao is located on Stetson Drive in Old Town Scottsdale. The Stetson salad is only $10.99 and they actually take pride in it. It's a must try.""",K5i2dYKJ,2197
2016,2018-03-14 20:30:42,"I went to Rosita's for the first time tonight after driving by it for about 20 years on my way to other establishments. Tonight was the night to try it out because a place we know we like looked really busy. The entry way was super crowded (not from being too busy) as customers who enter have to walk around the customers who are in line paying for their meals. It seemed like my kids were getting in people's way. I'll be the first to notice when my kids are being annoying, but in defense of their innocence on this occasion, I must say they had nowhere safe to stand as we waited for the hostess to return. My toddler was almost taken out by a bag of takeout food being offered to a customer standing in the very crowded foyer. How could I have explained that tragedy to his grandparents? \n\nWhen we were finally taken to the \dining room\"" I felt as if I had been magically swept away to a 1970's Waffle House. The lighting in this room -which consisted of ceiling fans and recessed can lights- could truly only be understood by folks who have found themselves in police interrogation rooms. The sunniness of the room does nothing for the ambiance, as it only makes patrons aware of how many crushed chips are on the floor and how the decor is reminiscent of the living room of an 85 year old \""winter visitor\"" from Minneapolis. Normally the decor of a place isn't something I would critique, but I would expect something a little more pleasant when price range is considered. It's like being asked to pay the price of a bottle of Dom and instead receiving Boone's Farm Wine. No, it doesn't break the bank, but seriously, this is AZ; some of our best Mexican food is served on a paper plate. I would never critique these places for their lack of ambiance. This place, however, with their $6 (for one) shrimp taco, doesn't warrant the price tag. \n\nUpon being seated our waitress took our drink orders. I decided to have the chicken mole (12.95) and my husband had the green chili chimi dinner (10.95). I think the kids' meals were a pretty good deal and I liked that I was able to order soup for my little guy. After our drinks came, we waited and waited to have someone bring us chips and salsa. We began to wonder if they were in fact complimentary here, as numerous members of the staff walked by without offering them. I finally asked our waitress for some as she walked by. She looked at me like I had a butt growing in the middle of my forehead and said, \""yeah, sure,\"" and kept walking. About 5 minutes later she stopped a busboy right in front of our table and told him that when he \""had the time\"" he should get us some chips. I was mildly annoyed. \nHe stopped what he was doing (I guess he had the time) and got them for us. Thanks big guy! \n\nWhen the food arrived I was in shock at the portion size. The meat on my plate was enough to serve my whole family. In my opinion this isn't always a good thing. I would rather be served less food and charged a smaller price. These grotesque portions have led to our country's reputation in the global community as the land of lard. Enchanting. The chicken mole itself was decent, nothing to write sonnets about, but it was good. It was served with some iceberg lettuce (tepid from the hot plate), pinkish tomatoes (delightfully flown in from Chile, I'm sure), and a warm, soft tortilla on the side. I liked it well enough. The boy's soup (ablondigas) was \""mildly seasoned\"" exactly as the menu proclaimed. The prevailing flavor was that of the saltines we crumbled over the top. Was this bad? No. He's 3, he likes \""mildly seasoned\"". He also seemed pleased with his very large meatball. My daughter must have enjoyed her taco, because she left no evidence of its existence on her plate. My husband's chimi was really good. In fact, if we find ourselves there again, I'd suggest splitting one of those with him. It was enormous. \n\nThe bill came to $39 and some change. I felt a little cheated, as I know places in this town where the experience would have been a bottle of Dom at a Boone's Farm price. At least I'll get some \""not too bad\"" warmed over chicken mole out of the deal.""",7FLKaiyU,3728

They did not have a hostess when we walked in and waited10 minutes before anyone talked to us. There were 3 other couples waiting before us too-who knows how long they were waiting for.  Then a waiter stopped by to tell us there was a 20 minute wait and he left all of us standing there without taking down our names.  We decided to take matters into our own hands and decided to write our names down in the books to \reserve\"" a table. Next we decided to sit in the bar and waited an additional 10 minutes before we were asked if we wanted drinks. Once we got drinks, the dirty martini's were great, we had to wait another 15 minutes before ordering appetizers. Once we got appetizers we were forgotten. Forty minutes later we decided to get our check. After telling the manager about our bad experience she did offer to give us our meal on the house but it was already 950pm (we got in just after 8pm) and we didn't want to wait another hour to eat.

The side door was not squared up so now it hangs funny. The quality of the front door is so poor that after just 3 years it has big cracks and is warped.

Definitely one huge highlight of this salon!  The blow out took about 40 min including wash and blow out.  The wash includes a wonderful little scalp massage, which I understand can be extended to ten minutes for $10, but the little massage that you get along with the regular wash is just great!  My sis has super short, curly hair and her blow out lasted for five full days and looked absolutely amazing!  I have medium length wavy hair and chose the \cosmopolitan\"" which is loose, flowy curls and it lasted 3 days.  Usually when I blow out my own hair it lasts five days looking just fine and then the last day is ponytail day.  (i know some people might be thinking it's gross or weird that i don't wash my hair very often but hey, that's me) So the only reason I think it lasts longer when I do it myself is because I blow it out straight w/o any curl.  Still, I was very pleased with the results and will definitely be back,  for the sleek look rather than any curl tho.

2050,2018-03-26 22:05:31,"The Siamese Cat was my very first Thai experience when I was about 8 years old, and I have to admit that at the time, I really didn't like it. Now that my palate has matured quite a bit, and the combined facts that I love Thai food and that this place is given some of the most consistently high ratings in the Phoenix area, I had to come back and give them their fair shake.\n\nI came for lunch time because I'm poor and I noticed on their website that they have very affordable lunch specials, one of which is my all time favorite Gang Karee. Upon walking through the door, I was struck by the fact that almost nothing had changed in 15 years. I was seated promptly and soon thereafter placed my order.\n\nWhile I waited for my food, another couple came in who clearly had a favorable report with the staff here. When they walked through the door, the server came immediately to them, welcomed them, and then realized that \their table\"" had yet to be wiped down from the previous customer. She quickly made the table available for them, and over the course of my meal I was struck by the rarity of this kind of familiarity between customers and staff in this KIND of place these days. They ordered their \""usuals\"" and \""you know how I like the spice\"". When the food was ordered, the customers had brought a holiday gift for the staff. I dont really know why Im writing about this, it just struck me that this place has THAT kind of clientele. Impressive.\n\nAnyway, the food came out and I liked what I saw. The menu advertised lunch specials come with rice, eggroll, and soup du jour. The soup actually came out first, and it was a remarkably simple soup, but definitely not lacking in the flavor department. It was some sort of garlic/ginger broth with a few vegetables floating around...it was a nice way to start the meal. The main plate came out and I was immediately struck by a couple odd things: this was the first time I had ever seen gang karee (a curry) served on a plate rather than a bowl, and the \""eggroll\"" was in fact two little tiny miniature eggrolls. They were cute, to be honest. Never really seen anyone make eggrolls like that, but they were good and tasty nonetheless.\n\nThe gang karee was fantastic. Very very good. Texture, flavor, doneness of the chicken, all just right. I did ask for the dish medium hot, and this was nowhere near that, but I didnt mind too much. The only thing I didnt like about the meal was the rice, which struck me as odd considering rice was probably the easiest thing to make on that plate. It just wasn't very good--it had a gritty texture, essentially flavorless, and there was too much of it as far as I was concerned. But hey, I didnt come here to eat rice, or at least not mainly to eat rice, so I only knock them slightly for this one.\n\nOverall, my experience was very good. The service was fast and friendly, the food was flavorful and well presented, and it was nice to give this place a personal second chance and to finally learn what this place truly has to offer. I will certainly be back at some point in the near future.""",D0KK771r,3556

She right away offered some appetizer ideas, and wine parings. All good offerings. We decided on a bottle of Vipra rossa. It was over all a good wine, and went well with dinner. Also we ordered the 3 Pair Buschetta. This little gem was awesome. It came to our table on a cutting board type platter. Three little buschetta slices each having a different topping. First was grape tomatoes and basil, the second had cannelini beans, and the third had prosciutto crudo and mozzarella. Ah Mazz ING. \n    Being that I wasnt feeling super adventurous on the meal, I just ordered the Diavola pizza for one. Average pizza I'd have to say, was not very inventive. Good presentation though.\n   Service was a five.""",JVMJZEbu,1301

Their asada burritos are filled with insanely large portions of meat and guac.  Their rolled tacos have a heap of cheese and guac and their red sauce is perfect for dipping.

2065,2018-01-23 02:29:17,"It's 1961 and we're having lunch in the courtyard of our Miami Beach hotel. Parker House rolls, sweet and salty, an open-face meatloaf sandwich with mushroom gravy. There's a surf board and a tiki carving amidst the flowers. But wait - something's wrong!! There's no humidity! Those are imported mushrooms in my gravy! I work to orient myself in time and space and find, what a relief, that I'm actually in Cafe ZuZu in downtown Scottsdale and it's 2010.\n\n The Valley Ho Resort, which houses the Cafe, is such a wonderful period piece. It opened in 1956 and was renovated in 2005 by a very wise design team that left the mid-century architecture and spirit intact. Cafe ZuZu is at the far end of the lobby, and its charming patio is surrounded with flowers. The decor is late 50's. If you're as old as we are, you'll recognize it instantly. The menu consists of \Flavorful American comfort food. Familiar favorites with a contemporary twist.\"" There are goodies like warm Maytag blue cheese fondue ($7.50), truffled grilled cheese ($9), beef stroganoff ($17), and (gross) tuna salad with cottage cheese which brings me back to my childhood a little too clearly.\n\n While waiting for our entrees, we received a basket of Parker House rolls. These are the nice squishy white bread treats that, if you can manage not to eat them all, make wonderful toys. You can mold them into sculptures, or shape them into little round beebees to shoot through your straw. My meatloaf sandwich ($11.25) was served on a thick piece of grilled white bread topped first with melty cheese, then the meatloaf, then the gravy. There was a mound of lumpless mashed potatoes alongside. They were so smooth Ken wondered if they were made from instant, but they tasted much too good for that. The portion was huge, I took half home (of course I knew I was going to have dessert). Ken had sauteed liver, beautifully prepared, atop a mound of kale that had been cooked with high quality bacon, sauced with a Madera reduction. He loved it. I surprised him by ordering a lemon meringue tart ($6) for us to share. There were several chocolate desserts that sounded good, but I had a vision of the mile high meringue toppings of my childhood. The tart had only modest swirls of meringue, but it had been made in such a way that it was creamy, as opposed to foamy, and it was really good.The lemon custard was the star. I remembered a gelatinous filling, but this was smooth and velvety, with just the right tart/sweet balance. The pastry was a cross between cookie and pie crust, and stood up well to the filling.\n\n This was not an inexpensive meal, but the portions are large and quality is excellent. Plus we had joined an organization called The Lunch Club, which every weekday, emails it's members a discount coupon for a restaurant in their specified zip code. So one of our entrees was free! (The discount coupons differ, some are 20% off the bill, others merely are for a free drink). But, to pay Cafe ZuZu the ultimate compliment - I'd come here and pay full price.""",4paiQVZ1,337

2069,2018-02-02 15:06:32,"My husband and I just had the best meal we've had in some time.   We started  by sharing the fall vegetable salad, singlehandedly the most innovative salad I've had in a long time-faro, kale, romaine, dates and almonds in a beautifully light (and properly) dressed  white balsamic dressing.  Lord have mercy, that was GOOD! We then shared the ricotta gnocchi with beef short rib, arugula and bread crumbs. The bread crumbs did not go unnoticed by me.  They added a \snap\"" to the gnocchi that was fabulous-beautiful texture!  We also shared the raviolini which was stuffed with pork and roasted mushrooms, topped with fresh arugula in a preserved lemon sauce. Again, innovative and unbelievably delicious.  So unexpected, so delicious and all recommended by our knowledgable waiter, Connor.   And because we each took a very long bike ride today (and because we are pigs), we treated ourselves to one dessert each! The sticky toffee cake and the affogato.  Both were very good but super sweet and I would not have them again together-a bit too much. But that was our mistake. We simply couldn't stop. Once I got used to the salt on the sticky toffee cake which was a bit shocking on the buds (trust me, I know all about the salty sweet thing-I was a fan of it before you were born), I grew to adore it. We also got the affogato which we both agreed was a bit too sweet. I would have liked to bite into something a bit more substantial than just nutella-and trust me, I dig nutella. To sum up our experience-GO!""",laFCnjzP,3364

2071,2018-05-10 17:08:59,"I have a confession to make. When I found out that I'd be visiting Scottsdale for work, I secretly thought that the places where we'd be eating and drinking for the week wouldn't hold a candle to my favorite spots in other cities I've visited, like San Francisco, LA, Chicago or NYC. Well, I was wrong and I will happily eat my slice of humble pie, especially if it's from The Herb Box. \n\nThe first thing I noticed about the spot was how open and stylish the space was. I loved the old timey bicycle decorating the back wall, I loved the funky upholstery, I loved the classy bathrooms even. \n\nMy preconceived notions continued to break down as I perused the menu. For lunch, the offered row after row of amazing options, from fresh made sweet potato chips to a lunch plat du fromage to a whole array of salads and sandwiches. I went with the coconut shrimp salad and when it came out I practically dove head first into the bowl, devouring the ridiculously fresh veiggies and freshly fried shrimp. I think at one point I cried out, \It feels like a garden is blooming in my mouth!!\"" The meal was complete with a nibble of some of those famous sweet potato chips and a gulp of their mango lemonade. \n\nThen why not five stars, you ask? Well, the service was slow. Very slow. They warned us that it might be as we had a large party, but 40 minutes for your dishes to come out just doesn't cut it, I'm sorry. When we asked about the progress our waiter said that it was due to all of our special requests, \""like asking for steak on your salad.\"" This confused me, as getting steak on your salad was an option listed on the menu, so it didn't seem so special to me. \n\nNevertheless, our waiter was a nice guy and I didn't begrudge him too much, or the ktichen staff, especially when the chef/owner checked in on us a couple of times to see how we were doing. Unfortunately for the first time we didn't have much to tell her as we had yet to receive any food. \n\nI think they may have felt bad because they sent out an amazing array of desserts. Everyone loved the cream cheese frosting on the red velvet cupcake but I found the cake very dry and tough. People also loved their dessert which was basically a giant Reese's peanut butter cup. We took their orange cream cupcake to our next destination as a gift and the recipient was one happy lady. \n\nSo, while in good conscience I can't give a place five stars when it takes forever for lunch, everyone else had received their food, and we were late to our next appointment because of it, but everything else was on par so I'm going to hope that it was a one-time fluke and give them the props that they deserve!""",oDvVIZHQ,3295

The fan vibe, people getting there at 11am when the gates open for a 1pm game, true baseball aficionados! \n\nIn the heart of Old Town Scottsdale, that means post game drinking is half a mile away, the location of this place is perfect!  \n\nIt's a small stadium.  You can see the players entering and exiting, catch an autograph and photo if you are lucky, and can view them warming up on the practice field right next door, then they move to the main field to warm up.  I seriously have not had so much fun and player interaction at a game before!!  If you are a Giants fan, you must visit for Spring Training!!  \n\nIf you have lawn seats, as I did, get there early and stake a spot with a blanket.  Friday night was completely packed.  My Saturday there was also packed, but also hot, so I did get there early to sit under some tree shade.  The lawn is the place to be for people watching on a Saturday for sure.  True fans come out of Friday, I felt.  Saturday was more for frat parties and guys watching girls boobs.  If you are on the lawn too, the restrooms here only have three stalls for the ladies.  The funny thing is, usually the line to the men's room is much longer!!  Truthfully I would pick the lawn over seats anyway because there is no shade in those seats, and they cost even more!  \n\nThe lawn area is also close to all the food.  Here's the rundown: \n\nGordon Beirsch Garlic Fries, can never go wrong there.  \nIsland noodles:  meh...I felt ridiculous being asian and buying \island noodles\"", it's like going to PF Chang's, and of course I was disappointed and thought their teriyaki drenched sweet stir fry noodles tasted like crap.  \nIn the main area where the food is, you can get a Hot Dog combo for $9 or $10 with a pickle and chips, but if you go to the lawn right next to the scoreboard, you can get the dog alone for $6.50.  \nMargarita's:  $9...really tasty and refreshing in the hot Scottsdale sun!  I think they called it a....Margaria...margarita/sangria.  It was really good.  \nLemonade $5.  Pretty steep, but I bought it anyway, refreshing in the heat, not as good as AT&T Park's lemonade, but a tad cheaper.  \nBBQ pulled pork and brisket sandwich.  Hefty portion of meat on white bread.  Pretty delish.  \n\nHeads up, if you are on the lawn during batting practice, watch out for flying balls and the men who will run you over trying to catch them!   \n\nIn the stadium, you can donate your money to get a hall-of-famer's autographed memorabilia.  I got Gaylord Perry's.  Also, their souvenir stand proceeds benefit I think it was the Boys and Girls club.  I don't know how much of it, but thought it was pretty cool that if I am dropping dough, that it's all for a good cause.  \n\nMy only complaint is the price of the lawn seats...good gawd, I can get Angels tickets at the regular season cheaper than these, but that's the price you pay to see our beloved Giants.  \n\nIf you park right in front of the stadium, be prepared to pay, however my parking price went to a charity organization who was running the parking lot.  If you get there early, you can street park for free.  On the back side of the stadium, there is structure parking for free...I found that out afterwards.\n\nI will definitely come back next year, but will plan my trip during the weekdays when it's less crowded.""",DUV5Jfhx,4854

The server made it his mission to find out which one it was making several trips to the taps and listing off names and styles until he found which one it was which was impressive. The servers and bartenders have genuine personalities,2SmSP5kZ,171

While it was a buffet, it was not \""all you can eat\"" as the food was not replenished enough. The food was cold, and they didn't have your typical \""fish fry\"" dishes like cole slaw, french fries, mac and cheese. Instead there was a horrendous selection of lasagna, some sort of stuffed pork dish, stuffing, gravy and some sort of pudding item for dessert. \n\nOn top of all that, the staff was rude. We had to wait for 5 minutes for the cashier, who when she finally cashed us out didn't ask us how the food was, or engage in any sort of pleasantries. \n\nStay away from this join, far away.""",bcTOm6oV,2721

2102,2018-06-04 23:19:48,"Found this place on Yelp and decided to write my first of many commentaries.  It was authentic home-cooked food, made with love.  Sounds corny, but if you spend much time on the road, it's not worth guessing by judging a book by its cover.  And this strip mall appearance would normally just result in a drive-by.  You would never even see it set back from the road.\n\nHad the herring appetizer which was awesome, and the swai filet.  It was buttery and soft, as you might expect.  The side dishes (kraut, cole slaw, beets, potatoes) all had a very original flavor and I liked most of them...a few were kind of heavy/creamy (the beets) and dill is used often - but that's what you mostly expect from cuisine from this region of Europe.  Gave 5 stars for the overall experience - food quality, price, quantity, ambiance, service, and love.  As Hanna (the owner) said about running this restaurant, \You have to love it\"".  And everyone there does, including the many regular customers.  I'll be back again Hanna.  So you can call me a \""regular customer too\"".  Take me to a family run restaurant like this anytime, and I will be back again and again.""",Z9mPoRTz,2513

I know, I know... this has its advantages.  But the big disadvantage, in my opinion, is that you never develop a personal relationship with your server.

And can re-create themselves into something new and different.\n\nAnd boy, do some people get into that.\n\nAnyway, I've seen people in here who looked like they had nothing to lose and somewhat acted the part. I've also seen people who reminded me that true wealth lies elsewhere than in a lease on a new BMW.

Impressive!  Finally a place to grab a quick, hassle-free lunch.  And, well, since they aren't open past 5:00PM or on weekends at all anyway, I guess this place has figured out its niche - the downtown lunch crowd.\n\nThey offer a huge variety of subs, pitas, and salads, most of which are your normal deli standards.  Most of the actual Greek offerings aren't even listed on the regular menu but as \""sides\"" - falafel, spanakopita, dolmades, hummus.\n\nWe ordered a gyro and a falafel platter. Be forewarned, the \""garnish\"" that comes with the falafel pita is essentially a side salad, I made the mistake of getting the side salad instead of one of the other sides and had two big mounds of veggies.  Not a big deal, just something to know for next time.  \n\nThe food itself wasn't spectacular by any means.  In fact, dare I say the gyro meat looked pre-pacakged and was DEFINITELY not freshly shaved off a big rack of lamb, the pieces were waaaay too uniform in size and shape.\n\nBut hey, 2 super-quick large meals and huge sodas for $15 works for me!""",6abBi9I5,3269

Whatever new supplier they are using is not nearly as good.  I asked an employee why they changed suppliers and they said BH is too expensive.  I am sorry, but you did not lower your prices.  BH is much better quality than whatever crap they're using.\n\n2.) I found out the secret to their delicious \homemade\"" creamy chicken noodle soup.\n\nApparently Dilly's simply uses a frozen chicken noodle soup (I believe the employee said it was Sysco) that they just add heavy cream to.\n\nYes, their creamy chicken noodle soup is delicious; However, I think I can manage to just make my own rather than pay $5 for not-even-close to homemade stuff.\n\n3.) Most of their employees just don't care about the customer.  \n\nYou will see what I mean when you show up to Dilly's within 45 minutes - an hour of closing time.  On the last two visits, I have heard employees say they were not going to make any new soup because they just wanted to start cleaning up.  On one visit, they only had ONE soup left and instead of telling the customer that... they just waited until she named every other soup and told her they were out.

My work finish early today so we wanted to see if we could exchange our first class tickets from the 4:30 flight  to the flight at 1:30 which still had lots of empty seats in first class.   The gal at the call center said sure, but the change fee would be $100 per person and an addition fee would be imposed for a one way ticket.   Of course, explaining to her that we were just changing the return leg of our ticket home did not constitute a one way ticket.   She informed us that it did... and to the tune of about $400 each.  So, to save 3 hours would have cost us a cool grand.   Nope.  No thanks, but spank you very much for trying that with us.   \n\nOh, it gets better.  We are not seated together in first which is not a big deal.  But we get there 2 hours early and ask to be put together.   The friendly gal at the check in desk says, sure no problem.  Then proceeds to take both our tickets and change my travel companions tickets twice.   So once again, we are seated apart.   We only know this because 30 minutes before we are to board, we read through the boarding passes.  Both were in her name.  Nice.   Oh, BTW, the plane was delayed an hour with no explanation and no warning.   Thanks.   \n\nSo, realizing the problem, the gate attendant says, yeah, you aren't sitting next to one another.   We, kindly informed her that we were supposed to because when we got our tickets that' s the set up we wanted.   Her reply was to tell the flight attendants and maybe they could do something on the plane.   To make a long story short, because one older lady was kind enough to move, we got to sit next to one another.   In flight, the flight crew took good care of us.   I can't complain about them at all.   They were top notch, but the ground crew isn't supporting them.   \n\nOh and to top it off, when we arrived, it took 30 minutes to get our one checked bag despite the bright \Priority\"" tag on it.

He pulled out my chair for me, called me all different terms of endearment, was incredibly attentive, etc etc. \n\nWhen my boyfriend asked if they had lemonade, Pavle said \no, but I have simple syrup and lime juice in the back. How about a limeade?\"" It seems silly, but that was such a great touch. Also, the limeade was awesome!\n\nWe ordered the moz/leeks/egg dish and oh, wow. The leeks were cooked perfectly, the bread crumbs added the perfect crunch, and the egg mixed with the delicious, warm, gooey mozzarella was the perfect mixture of tastes and texture. Wow. \n\nWe also ordered the grilled spicy broccoli with pistachios. Perfect amount of spiciness - not so bland that you're questioning where the heat went, but not so spicy to where your mouth is on fire for minutes afterward. The broccoli was thick and cooked perfectly - grilled and still crisp. \n\nBoth my boyfriend and I are vegetarians and were told that we could order a specially made plate. Because we were so full from the two appetizers, we split a vegetarian entree.\n\nAnd again ... wow. We were given a plate overflowing with food. It was a trio of dishes - broccoli with (we think) cumin rice and a tomato garnish/sauce, potatoes with pea pods and (I believe...) spinach, and beans with spinach, and an array of green leafies. Each bite was more delicious than the one prior. We hardly talked as we devoured the food. So good, so tasty - everything was seasoned perfectly and perfectly cooked. \n\nI was so excited to have a vegetarian dish that wasn't just pasta with a vegetable thrown in. It is so nice to have an innovative vegetarian dish that truly felt like it was made creatively. Pavle told us he truly appreciated the assessment of the vegetarian food, and we let him know how absolutely wonderful it was.\n\nHe also let us know they have a vegetarian tasting menu once every few months, which trust me, we'll be going to. \n\nOverall, one of the best dining experiences I've had in a very long time.

The best part is that the price is set at a bargain $35 for all 3 courses and they offer a simple cocktail (last night was a cherry lime martini) and a simple red and white wine each for $5! (The rest of the wine list is available though!) \n\nAs always, the service was impeccable and I really enjoyed the Bartender! He was super helpful and even clued us in on one additional special starter they were offering of a sea urchin panna cotta with lobster for $14. Now the BF and I love sushi, but aren't huge uni fans. OMG am I glad we tried it! The BF described it as the ocean with a touch of cream! Pure heaven! \n\nOur second course arrived as a simple salad of beets. It was fantastic and we both nearly licked our plates clean! For the entree course, the BF had the flat iron steak, while I had the halibut. Both were simple, delicious and wonderful! There was nothing left of either and specifically, the celery roon and parsnip puree was amazing! \n\nNext came the standard cotton candy course which is always fun and then dessert! Who doesn't like an ice cream sundae with all the toppings of your choice!?!? The BF literally ate all the hot fudge while I indulged in the roasted pine nuts, strawberry sauce, cookie crumble and cherries! So delicious!! \n\nReally, this food is great and I love the idea of the simple Sunday menu!

2184,2018-05-04 05:25:41,"So I get to the US Airways Center, which is two blocks away from Chase Field. The idea was to find the cheapest parking available while still maintaining a close distance to the park. I went down Washington St. and parked in the structure for the Collier Center shopping mall. Eight bucks. Not bad. As a comparison for how good the price is, parking in relatively the same place at PETCO Park costs $20! It was all of a two block walk to the stadium because going up to street level put me right in front of the US Airways Center. I entered the right gate area, too. Just lucked on while walking on Jefferson St.\n\nSo Section 140 was the Bleacher section, which, I gotta say, is much better than the Bleacher section at PETCO Park in my hometown of San Diego. The bench seating could've been a little softer, but the view towards the plate was much better than PETCO Park, where it seems like home plate is miles away. Instead of an uncomfortable single chair, you could stretch out on the benches, which I did during the game because the seats next to me and to my left were never occupied by anyone. I walked along the sections and concourse on the first tier only. No sense in having to go to the second tier or the upper decks if I didn't have to. Honestly? Being inside Chase Field (which the climate-controlled cool environment was a savior against the heat outside) reminded me of my visit to Houston's Minute Maid Park in 2007. The field is structured in much the same manner and there are quirks about the centerfield batter's eye. In Houston, it was Tal's Hill. Here, it's just a giant JumboTron screen. I didn't get the hangar feeling from being inside, but rather a more boxy feeling. Would've been interesting to see the place with the roof open. Um, the pool's an interesting feature of the park. Being the lifeguard there must be the cushiest job in the park.\n\nI guess there isn't much to report after that. I mean, I walked the concourse then returned to my seat to watch some of the warmups in the bullpen. Edwin Jackson was just coming off his ridiculous 149-pitch no-hitter against Tampa Bay and got lots of love from the fans about it. The Dodgers? Not so much. Is it just me, or do Dodgers fans tend to flock to where I'm usually sitting? The last time I went to a game against the Dodgers, it was the middle of May, and Dodgers fans invaded section 120, where Derrick and I were sitting. I mean, in this case, it seemed like the Bleacher section was half Dodgers fans and half D-Backs fans. One guy was even decked out in a Manny Ramirez jersey adorned with Laker colors. Eventually, the dude got kicked out by security. Dodgers fans... They're an unruly bunch. And I think it starts young, too. There were a couple of Dodgers fans sitting behind me who looked like they weren't more than five years old. One of them kept spitting on me when he was shouting for the Dodgers and another kept kicking the bench out of boredom. The father figure with them just stared straight ahead into space for much of the time. Dude! Rein in your frakking kids! Just makes me hate Dodgers fans even more. It was so bothersome that I had to move a row down during the fifth inning.\n\nThe Diamondbacks need to inject more youth into their fanbase, though. Most of the fans I sat with were senior citizens. The Diamondbacks are interesting throughout the game. Much different from the Padres during their home games. I think the JumboTron scoreboard in center gives way too much information, but I guess it's better than having too little information. At least they don't play a lot of filler music between innings like at PETCO. They had a \Muscle Cam,\"" which I thought was interesting, a \""Legends\"" foot race where men dressed as oversized versions of Diamondback legends Mark Grace, Randy Johnson, Luis Gonzalez, and Matt Williams engaged in a race along the first base line, and Baxter, an oversized rodent for a mascot riding in on a motorcycle. Honestly, we got that beat with the Swingin' Friar mascot. I did like the original idea of coming in at the home plate entrance and being able to make signs to show during the game. I wish all MLB teams did something like that. Fans weren't much into the game, despite being up by as much as six runs at one point. Oh! Hot dog and soda for $8.75? Not bad. Beer from the floating vendors in a small cup for $7.50?! Bad. Restaurant choices around the park aren't bad. Interesting to note that there were a couple of guys selling Jolly Rancher smoothies in our section. That looked odd.""",NaDU3fml,1361

Hands down.  On this past Monday night, I went on a taco bender and ate nine tacos in a row - three cochinita pibil and six carne asada.  I really couldn't get enough of them.  And they have Negra Modelo on tap; I don't know why I ever eat anywhere else.\n\nGallo Blanco is a Mexico City style taqueria, and based on my visits to the D.F., it succeeds in its authenticity.  But Gallo Blanco is also a pretty cool place to eat in good ole Phoenix, Arizona, U.S.A.  Good food transcends ethnic boundaries.\n\nWhile the tacos are delicious, Gallo Blanco is more than just tacos - a standout on their menu is the elote - a cotija cheese and paprika spiced cob of corn.  And the guac; where to start with the guac . . . whoever came up with the recipe was a culinary genius.\n\nDid I mention that Gallo Blanco is a great value, too?  Their chorizo and egg breakfast weighs in at an easy-on-the-wallet $5.00.  The tacos hover in the $2.00 price range depending on the ingredient.  Dinner for two, with drinks, can be had for a very reasonable price tag.  Even the drinks are kick ass: I had the opportunity to sample Gallo Blanco's margarita ($7.00) one Thursday evening, and then Barrio Caf\u00e9's \""Cadillac\"" margarita ($12.00) the next day.  Edge: Gallo Blanco. \n\nHere's a tip: try Gallo Blanco's chilaquiles for breakfast.  Chilaquiles are best described as \""breakfast nachos;\"" they are basically corn tortilla pieces cooked in salsa, and sprinkled with cheese, served for breakfast with eggs.

Then there are some who feel like it's more business oriented.  I'm not sure that thought ever came to my mind, but has another individual.\n\nThere was one fellow who transferred out to NCNM because he felt that it gave him the best opportunity to study homeopathy.  I'm not exactly sure in what capacity this may be, but for him, that was his driving factor along with other issues he was not happy with.  The thing to remember is whatever your issues are with a place, will not be what another issues are.  And vice-versa.  \n\nI think what many people lose sight of is that medical schools are bound to teach you a particular curriculum based on the boards which are given by the governing and accrediting organization.  For example, initially, some people may be disgruntled by the level of allopathic teaching which we experience in our first two years.  However, if a school was to teach you pure Nature Cure, then what good will this do you for when you need to take your boards?  Thus, it is not necessarily the schools \fault\"", it is the systems fault for making the test more allopathically weighted.  This occurs at any school because everyone is subjected to the same board exam.  One can make the argument however that one school may filter the information differently and design the curriculum around this \""issue.\""\n\nI personally feel that if you are going to enter into a profession of naturopathic medicine, and the structure of medicine is heavily allopathic, it behooves you to know allopathic medicine.  For me, I want to know how they think, what they do, and be able to have the highest level of competence when communicating my understanding of their system whether it be with patients or other medical providers, particularly in the allopathic model.  Being already under the microscope, I think it is imperative to know it all.\n\nMuch of medicine is learned after you graduate, thus, to some degree arguing over which school is superior only goes so far.  My feeling is that in order to prepare yourself for when you graduate, you have to supplement your learning with textbooks and other philosophies that lie outside the parameters of your education received in whatever institution you attend.\n\nSCNM is relatively young in its history.  Therefore, it is still working out its kinks as it grows which is the main reason for 4 stars.   It's just par for course.  It is beginning to expand it's campus amenities I believe in the next year with additional buildings and other things which furthers my point.  I believe in time, this school will keep getting better as it's history shows. \n\nAs for the profession as a whole, I think there is much discord with respects to how it's moving forward. Since medicine is an art, and every individual is their own entity, it creates division and differences.  To try and put it into words is in some sense a bit futile.  But times have changed and things evolve, so I'm not even saying that this is a negative thing.  However, I would say that Naturopathic Medicine should remain as close to the philosophy of Nature Cure by Henry Lindlahr as possible.  I would highly recommend the read to any person thinking of becoming an ND.  And I do find it disgraceful for any person graduating as an ND who hasn't read it.\n\nI would go here again if given the choice to become an ND.  Your education is what you make it.  There are some very knowledgeable people here and I think the journey in naturopathic medicine is one definitely worth taking.  The only true source of wealth is your health, so you mine as well know as much as you can about it.""",wndVETt7,1385

2200,2018-04-18 06:05:25,"Two colleagues and I visited this place for lunch today.  Only a so-so experience.  I have been to Via de many, many times having grown up in the Sunnyslope area.  They have consistently had good food and great margaritas.  But today's experience will make it tough to recommend.\n\nWe were seated promptly and had waters and chips and salsa soon thereafter.  We took some time to look at the menu and decided on 2 MaryLou's with red sauce and a green corn tamale.  They were all lunch specials that came with our choice of rice and beans.  The food arrived within about 10 minutes and everybody enjoyed their meal.  \n\nMy major gripe about this place was the service.  Once our meals were delivered we didn't see a server again.  I had to stop a staff member who was passing by to get some water refills (we were all down to less than 1/2\ inch of water in our already small glasses).  No one came by to check and see if we were enjoying our meals or if we needed anything else to complete the meal.  When we were ready to leave, we had to go up to the front to get our bill and a to go box.  Via de is a place where you pay at the register but I still expect the bill to at least be dropped off.  They didn't appear to be exceptionally busy and I saw customers at two other tables looking around for someone to assist them.  Bad, bad service.  I don't know that I would head back when there are plenty of great Mexican food places in town with much better service.""",SCmEMmdl,4550
2201,2018-01-10 18:38:14,"While in Scottsdale with some family, we all decided that the trip would be for naught if we didn't try some local Mexican food. While I was thrilled at the prospect of some Mexican in a region known for it's amazing authentic options, I was a bit dissapointed with the Spotted Donkey Cantina.\n\nFirst off, the Spotted Donkey Cantina is a nice place, with a calming atmosphere and servers that are both well-dressed and well-versed.  Additionally, the options are unique (although not what I would call \authentic\"") and I would be surprised if anyone found they were unable to find a dish they were excited to order.\n\nHowever, when my food finally arrived (chili as an appetizer and enchiladas for the main course), I was a bit disappointed to find that my dishes were a bit underwhelming.  Both the pork chili and the enchiladas were almost entirely devoid of meat, instead containing mostly fillers like chopped tomatoes, cheese and beans.  As I'd paid nearly $20 in total for both, this was extremely disappointing.\n\nHead over to the Spotted Donkey Cantina if you're looking for a good atmosphere for a business dinner or a date, but keep away if you're looking for either authentic Mexican cuisine or a bang for your buck.""",78slGv7J,4907

It's also kinda funny to me how sushi-lovers love to hate sushi restaurants. It's like you ask a sushi fanatic where to go and they snidely scoff and mumble something about an exotic little place off the coast of wherever that they've probably only been to once if at all and suggest you might as well pick up a steamy dog shit off the lawn and eat that if you're going to eat at whatever place you were asking about. \n\nI think it's meant to make the rest of us feel stupid for not being an expert. Well I'm a novice - I've only been to about a dozen different sushi places probably less than 50 times. I like the stuff, but I'm not from Japan or anything... I don't have it in my blood. I just know what I like and I tend to get the same or similar things wherever I go. \n\nSo given my experiences with sushi places and restaurants in general, I have to say this place is great. The servers were friendly and attentive, the decor was nice and kinda swanky without being overdone, the music sucked but wasn't too loud, and the food was quite good. If that doesn't make a 5 star joint, I don't know what does.\n\nWe had a roll and a teriyaki chicken dish from the menu along with a small bottle of sake that we bombed. Everything was crazy good. Oh, and we had edemame as well. The roll was pretty huge compared to most places and the chicken dish was ridiculously huge. For all the food we had, the prices were pretty reasonable. \n\nTo be honest, I expected this place to suck. The location, the outside, the name, etc... it all kinda gave the impression this wasn't going to be any good. Well, it was... so I guess... don't judge a book by its cover? \n\nThis isn't a chain, it doesn't smell fishy inside (at least it didn't when I was there), and it's clean. Compared to places like zen32 or stingray, this place holds its own. I think it kicks Ra in the ass - and I kinda like Ra okay. I ventured into the bathroom and it was clean and nice, but a little hodge-podgey (2 different styles of sink)... nice though... and clean. \n\nI was actually a little shocked to see so many negative reviews after enjoying it so much... I guess that's the beauty of this site - it's all opinions, so nobody gets to be \right\"" and nobody has to be \""wrong.\"" If you're like me and you enjoy your Americanized sushi restaurant grills, you may really enjoy this. If you're a sushi genius, your mileage may vary.""",dSYWJiaF,1327

It was my first time there and I forgot to tell them I want the cod because I read in yelp that was the best. I guess the default was the catfish. It took a long time for the food to be ready. The only reason I gave it 1 stars was because the shrimp was not bad. I wish the breading for the shrimp was used for the fish I think that would have made a big difference.

Parking is along the building's north wall (on Cypress), which now displays a mural by one of the artists.\n\nMy friend and I stumbled upon the Bee's Knees by word of mouth and just happened to catch the shop open on one of their off days.  The owners, Julia and her husband (who is one of the artists featured in the gallery), let us shop and peruse the place even tho' they were technically closed.  The shop itself sells antiques, resale clothing/accessories, and some artist-crafted jewelry and quirky items.\n\nI'm a larger size and was happy to see that there was a XL section with a couple of great finds.  Though, my friend, who is a S found just as much as I did.  My favorite part about the shop is the HUGE mirror in the clothing area...you rarely get to try on clothes where you can see EVERYTHING!  They have a large selection of men's and women's jeans...so there's something for everyone.  Also found a great pair of earrings--one of the artists takes old skateboards and makes earrings out of them...yea for recycling!  They're fabulous!!\n\nI'm not sure exactly what it was about the inside of the shop, but even though it had high ceilings, it was comfy and almost homey...could have been the free chocolates up at the desk or the owners' hospitality or the nostalgic antiques lining the wall.

I had a manager Leah who acted very peppy and up beat to customers and would criticize them (f bombs and all) over the headset as they walked away...she seriously had a dark soul to be working at the Disney store. They try to hand you bags, because you are more likely to buy more if you put your items in a bag. Be careful about bringing little ones, because if they ask you for something and you say no, workers aka cast members are trained to chime in with retaliations like, \its a saLe item for a limited time only\"" etc. \n\nAdvice for shoppers:\nWhen Disney wants to get rid of items they will practically give the items away through their awesome sales. Also, be conscious that Disney is a master of packaging. Things may be presented well in the store and packaged neat, but you bring it home, tear the cardboard and plastic off and you are left with a dinky toy that you paid too much for. \n\nOverall, everyone loves Disney and its a magical unique experience that can't be replicated. Just don't spend too much time shopping because the high school musical videos they play on a loop at the store will drive you nuts. :)""",rGWqa3iO,4071

FOH was in fine form (from the immediate greeting at the hosts' stand; to server Cort's affable personality & eagerness to please, as well as server Travis' assistance throughout the evening; and yet another server's readiness to show me to the restroom, instead of pointing the way.  (An example of four-diamond service, and I should know, since we're given the four-diamond spiel daily where I work!)  When I inquired deeper into the Legend City cocktail's ingredients, Cort offered to have Scott Stephens, the drink's inventor and BT's co-owner, come out to greet and tell me about it himself!  \n\nAs soon as I crossed the wide-open sliding-door glass panels and into the restaurant, I was in-love w/ the ambience!  It's rustic St. Francis (and a little bit of The Parlor) meets laid-back, yet mysteriously sexy Olive & Ivy.

Where shall I start??\nLet me preface by saying that I already knew what I wanted, having checked out the menu online after reading about Opening Night at BT (but I'd already eaten, darn it!), but I played along and had a look at the lovely watermarked printed menu Cort gave me.

Wanted to try the Legend City cocktail, but wasn't sure what \ricard\"" was (and now know, thanks to Scott!).  When Cort came back for my drink order, I asked \""the short ribs (a fave of one of the hosts'), or the osso bucco?\""  W/out batting an eyelash, Cort said \""get the osso bucco; it's my favorite on the entire menu!\""  Sold!  As I waited for my biscuits and macaroni dish, I spied next table's inhabitants (Hi Karen and Elsa!) breaking into their table bread, so I asked Cort if I could have some, too, please!  Looking all around me, at the hustle-bustle of the kitchen and everyone's smiling faces, I knew I was in for a treat!\n\nThe bacon cheddar biscuits were delightful!  Loved the crusty cheese topping, and I enjoyed feeling the weight of the biscuit in my hands as I tore off a piece to peer inside-- it was like I was on slow-mo' breaking bread!  (Cue in \""Six Billion Dollar Man\"" bionic sound effect here.)  You must order this and smell the aroma!  It tasted heavenly, and while the apple-honey butter was tasty, its presence wasn't needed.  The complimentary bread rolls were also delicious!  Take away the biscuits and leave me the rolls, and I'd still be happy!  Don't forget to mention the mac 'n cheese!  They don't make the pastas in-house, but they are ordered in especially (\""no ordinary pasta,\"" said Cort).  The tasty cream sauce consisted of a blend of some of my favorite cheeses, which included asiago, fontina, manchego, and white cheddar.  Crispy pancetta on top sealed the deal.  I may just have to order this side dish every time I visit!\n\nNext came the pork osso bucco confit.  I neglected to ask which local butcher shop the pork came from, so I can't say.  However, I will say that this dish, on the whole, was a beauty!  It came w/ butternut squash spaetzle (so pretty!) and crisp roasted veggies (golden beets, yellow squash, brussels sprouts, shallots, and perhaps leeks).  The pork confit sat atop a lovely and piquant black pepper reduction.  While I thought that the presentation could've been better (the pork itself didn't look quite finished, temp-wise, but I assure you it was!), the textures and flavor bouquets in this dish were very pleasing, indeed.\n\nSo what came next?  Could anything else impress me after all I've tried?  Ah, yes.  I ordered the Death By Chocolate, which was chocolate ganache on top of dense chocolate cake filled w/ chocolate buttercream, w/ a dusting of finely-grated chocolate on top.  Y'know, just for looks.  Jeez-louise!  Talk about killing me softly!  I've achieved transcendence.  For now.\n\nI'll be back- thanks BT!""",c11avYVh,2440

We decided to come on Wednesday in order to enjoy Wine Wednesday. We sat at the bar for a tasting and the bartenders were so friendly and knowledgeable. Our table was ready before we were done with our tasting but the hostess was very courteous and said just to check in with her when we were ready. \n\nFor dinner we were seated outside about a half hour before sunset. We each ordered the short rib as a starter,1hCK9WIZ,730

2242,2018-05-22 12:10:33,"If only the food and service were as well done as the interior....\n\nWhen our group of 8 entered this restaurant, I had very high hopes, The exposed brick and vents make the atmosphere very enticing, although a bit loud. We were seated right away, and our table was ready on time, so the experience started out well enough. However, it was all downhill from there.\n\nFirst, the table was not at all conducive to socializing. The last time I checked, a group of 8 doesn't go out to dinner just for their health...they actually want to talk. It was basically as though we were four couples dining side by side with no room between our tables, if that makes sense. Each of the girls in the group sat on the bench, while the guys sat on the chairs...again, you could really only talk to the person across from you or right next to you. That was annoying, and I am also blaming that for the urge I felt to go out afterwards, which lead to the hangover I have today.\n\nAnyway, it then took at least 10 minutes for our drink orders to be taken and another 10 minutes for them to arrive. The service was just not quick or friendly for that matter. I suppose the waiter was knowledgeable, as he did correct me in my pronunciation of the dish I ordered, but he sure didn't appear very on the ball throughout our meal. My husband had the duck, which was okay - he wasn't raving about it. It said \crispy,\"" which it wasn't really, so that disappointed him. I ordered a pasta dish, which was basically a bowl of salt. Sure, it had capers and olives, but it was WAY too many capers and olives. If I had been in the mood for pure olives, I would have ordered the appetizer bowl of them. I ate the dish because it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't good either.\n\nThe meal was not correctly paced, and none of the food I tasted impressed me. I tried Kristin's scallops, and they were way overcooked. I tasted my husband's duck, and while I don't like duck anyway, it didn't even have a good flavor or sauce.\n\nDigestif has some major kinks to work out if it's going to make it long term...there are way better restaurants in the area.""",kvqOT7iU,824

2252,2018-04-30 09:23:24,"Shocked I'm the first to review this. \n\nMaxim is exactly the kind of place Yelp was created for. I may be the first Yelper but rest assured when you walk in that, though you may not recognize the faces, the customers around you will include assistant Attorneys General, a legislator or two, the governor's chief of staff, etc etc. My most recent celebrity sighting there was former Arizona U.S. Attorney Paul Charlton (a component of the US Attorney firing scandal in Washington, for political junkies). \n\nMaxim is a small, dingy Vietnamese/Chinese restaurant located in a crappy strip mall in a sketchy part of town. The tiny parking lot is in serious need of repair. You will likely have to step over a mysterious puddle of water, or something, to get out of your car or get to the entrance. The restaurant is inconveniently located a mile or two west of downtown, and can be slightly annoying to find if you don't know exactly where it is. Which should tell you a lot, considering its popularity with downtown workers, like Mr Charlton. \n\nThe strip mall is itself a bit of an oddity because every small business within it is Vietnamese-owned. I hope for the sake of our Vietnamese community that this isn't Phoenix's \Little Saigon\"" but it might well be. \n\nA polite gentleman who speaks very little English will take your order. The lunch combo selections are what you would expect at any Chinese restaurant, plus a variety of Vietnamese choices. The food is tasty. Delicious soup accompanies every meal. I think my favorite small detail is the simple fact that every table in the place includes everything you need, 3-4 different kinds of sauces to spice up your entree, napkins, all at your fingertips from the moment you sit down. \n\nDespite my description of the run-down strip mall, I should point out that Maxim while being no-frills is clean. I checked its county health inspection records on-line and they are very good (4 golds and 5 silvers since October 2004). No surprise considering how often I see government folks lunching here (since they know better than the rest of us).\n\nI have no idea what the story behind the name of the restaurant is. No, I have not seen any hot Maxim calendar girls there.""",vk71dchL,2605
2253,2018-02-15 18:19:39,"We went here twice during spring training/spring break last week- it was THAT good! I'm hungry now just thinking about their delicious pizza. Both times we got a table without waiting, although it was very crowded- a good sign. \n\nThe first time, my daughter and I shared a meatball and mushroom pizza with tomato sauce. The crust is fabulous! She liked folding it over to eat \new york style\"" so I tried that too and it actually did make it thicker and chewier- may have started a new tradition in eating style. Ha. Hubby and son shared a pepperoni and it was equally good. The pepperonis are miniature in size, but great in quantity used, and cooked perfectly where they crisp up a bit on the edges. Yum!\n\nThe second trip, son and I decided to try the ricotta cheese pizza without red sauce (they use garlic and olive oil instead), and the server recommended sausage and onion. We got sausage and mushroom (I would have gotten onion too, but for the boy). Oh my gosh. Heavenly!!!!! Loved the ricotta combo. Hubby and daughter enjoyed pepperoni and meatball with red sauce. \n\nWe shared a large Caesar both times, which was plentiful. I would have preferred trying one of their other salads, but oh well. Gave in for the sake of the family. \n\nThe staff was pleasant and friendly both times as well. The manager came over and talked with us the second trip, when he saw my son's lacrosse tshirt- struck up a lax conversation. Fun. Oh- and our server the first time told us we got $5 off because of our hotel, and the hotel shuttle took us and picked us up.

I've always eaten up at the bar and the same bartender has been there to serve me over several years and he always goes above and beyond service expectations (I really appreciate that he always wants to know if I like my food after the first bite and always asks if I want a go cup for my drink as I'm paying).

He said that he thought sewage gas was leaking into the home and that we should contact the other plumber to fix it and that when we did he would come back and check the other plumber's work and include that return visit on the same invoice at no additional charge.  He was in the house for a total of five minutes which is why he said he would come back and include the return visit as part of the same invoice.\n\nApparently the company expected to be paid in full before the plumber returned to our home.  And so a representative called me and said that I needed to pay the full invoice before the plumber returned to the home.  I said that I thought it was reasonable that we would pay after the plumber came back and visited the home to complete the work he said he would do.  The representative was very rude and began yelling on the phone and saying that they did not work for free.  She actually said this: \It sounds like you're trying to screw us.\""  I was meanwhile very calm and was telling her that I had every intention of paying but wanted to pay when the plumber returned to finish the work.  This was of course contingent upon the other company finishing what they had to do.  I wanted to work out a timeline of when this would be reasonable but she told me that the plumber would not come out until we got paid.  I told her that I would not pay until the plumber came out and before I could work out a timeline of when this should happen she hung up on me and said she would send me to collections.\n\nTo be fair, I was able to call back and set up a payment timeline with another representative from the company who was more reasonable, and the plumber that visited the house was indeed friendly and appeared competent.  But the way that I was spoken to by the first representative left such a sour taste in my mouth that I will never do business with them again.  If those are the types of people they employ, there is something wrong with the business.  If that's as well as they train people that talk on the phone to customers, there is something wrong with the business.\n\nI can't believe that a company expects to get paid such large amounts of money for not doing any work at all and then accuses clients of expecting free work when they don't want to pay until a job is completed.\n\nI am not a customer who doesn't want to pay.  I have every intention of paying Scottsdale Plumbing company once they complete the work they said they would do.  But I was cut off by this rude representative before I was even given an opportunity to establish what would be a reasonable timeline or deadline for when this plumber would return to our home.  I have never had a company representative hang up on me before.  I thought they were all trained not to do that.  And here this lady was trying to collect money from me, but instead hung up on me.  She kept stressing how they could not afford to do work for free (which I was not asking anyone to do).  I suppose what they can afford to do is to lose customers, which is what will continue to happen if they speak to them the way that I was spoken to.\n\nA tip to the company: if you want people to pay you, try being a little nicer when you ask them for money.""",J5F9mNou,1458

This is a family run place at its best!\n\nLocated on a quiet street in a row of older homes the uniqueness oozes from the inside and out.  It's very small inside with only about eight tables inside and maybe three outside.  So they don't serve to a vast amount of people.

This year our original tickets was on a rainy & chilly Saturday night and thankfully the staff was helpful in allowing us to change to the next Saturday as the event wasn't officially rained out *yet* but this really would have killed it for us.  The next Saturday was dry and cool ... almost perfect!  We have been to DBG in the day many times and loved seeing the gardens in a whole different ... light.   The luminarias are really a special thing and the THOUSANDS of them are really something!  - This really is an adult event as I didn't see a bunch of kids (thankfully) as this probably won't hold their attention.

Even though I just spent a day at the spa enlightening myself and committing to a healthy lifestyle, I caved when my husband threw out the idea of the Grind for dinner.  There's always tomorrow! \n\nThe Grind is located in a strip mall off of 40th and Camelback, and is pretty easy to miss.  So keep your eyes peeled!  When we entered, we felt very comfortable in the space that was modern enough to attract the Scottsdale crowd, but welcoming enough to have that \Cheers\"" type feel.  The bar is definitely the focal point of the restaurant, as it takes up a majority of the space in the front.  While I didn't get a drink this time around, they had numerous classic cocktails on their menu that few restaurants advertise-- the Manhattan, the Moscow Mule, the Ramos Gin Fizz.  That was enough to intrigue me. \n\nAfter perusing the menu, it was a pretty easy decision.  I ordered the Sweet and Spicy Burger with candied jalapenos, fried ratatouille, and watercress, while my husband ordered the Peppercorn Crust Burger with charred onions, and matchstick fries.  First off, the burgers are HUGE!  Come with an appetite and room in your stomach. You'll need it!  \n\nSecond, while very different in flavor, both burgers had the same texture to them, which seems to be a common theme judging by the ingredients of other items on their menu.  I'm normally not very adventurous when it comes to burgers, but man was I surprised with how much I enjoyed this one.  If you like a kick to your meals, this definitely deserves a try.  The candied jalepenos were a really nice touch, and the meat was cooked a perfect medium rare and super juicy.  \n\nWe also ordered a side of the Herbed \""home style\"" fries to accompany the burgers, but they were nothing special.  I'd try a different side next time we visited, and yes, we will be back!""",JnnodgB9,3117

I will admit that I LIKED the film, even though people around me didn't.  (In fact, the more I think about the film, the more I'm enamored w/ the story.)\n\nLast night was my first visit to the venue, and I'm impressed!  Loved the stadium seating; open-air feel; and its excellent video and sound systems.  The lobby was very spacious, which I love, and seems to be a nice area to relax and socialize while waiting for a show/event to start.  Since I'd already eaten before joining up w/ other Yelpers for this event, I do not know if the venue offers refreshments, but I'm assuming it does, since other art theaters do; I will investigate further into the matter on my next visit, which I hope will be very soon!  \n\nTe Vaka or Late-Nite Catechism, anyone?\n\nOne complaint: Leg space is a bit cramped.  Thank goodness the older couple in front of us left (about 3/4 into the movie), because I then could stretch my legs in front of me.  I'm sorry they felt they had to leave, but I'm grateful for the extra space!  LOL  \n\nFYI: The opening sequences (specifically the planet scenes and the music score) hailed similarities to Terence Malick's \""Tree of Life,\"" which I felt was too indulgent- liked a few scenes, but overall did not enjoy the film-- perhaps my opinions will change if I give it another chance, but truth be told, the movie was so long and left me feeling so distanced, I doubt I want to spend any more of my time on Earth watching it again!).

It let's me know the status of my order in real time so I am constantly aware of where it's at in the process.  From order placed, to prep, to bake, to quality check, and finally out for delivery.  In the age of wanting real-time information, the Tracker is genius!\n\nI love the American Legends pizzas.  My favorites are the Pacific Veggie (roasted red peppers, spinach, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes and black olives with feta and provolone cheeses on a parmesan thin cracker crust) and the Firey Hawaiian (sliced ham, bacon, pineapple, roasted red peppers, jalape\u00f1os, hot sauce, and provolone cheese on a parmesan crust) on thin or Brooklyn style.\n\nThe only drawback to ordering pizza is that the dog won't leave us alone when we have it, she wants some too and will stare us down.

While the chicken itself was not huge, it comes with Spaghetti, an entire loaf of bread and butter, and a side salad.

2335,2018-02-24 19:19:12,"Update: We finally got the album, a year and a half later. And that was AFTER the first version they sent was full of pixellated images, inconsistent borders, and other mistakes that looked extremely amateur. Of the 20 pages, more than half had errors on them. And this was AFTER they claimed they thoroughly checked the photos. It was a nightmare! We waited 3 more months to get the second, corrected album.  It is beautiful but we couldn't believe that after all this time, they would send the initial product in such poor condition, and then seem surprised when we pointed out all the errors! It was a terrible experience. And now, nearly two years after our wedding date, we have yet to receive the DVD slideshow we paid for as part of our $5600 package. \n\n\nOriginal review:\nA year after my wedding, I am still waiting for the album. They did a fine job of covering the wedding and taking photos.\n\nMy biggest issue is not the product. It's that they made us feel like they were doing us a favor, even though we paid nearly $6000 for our wedding pics and album, we always felt we had to be on eggshells when asking for anything. They were always very quick to respond to emails about our payments but anytime we asked about when our photos would be ready or about our album, it took days to get a response. We didn't get to see our wedding photos until about 4 months after they were taken. They told us it would take 6-8 weeks.\n\nNONE of our other wedding vendors was anything like this. Everyone else was extremely professional and responded to everything in a timely fashion and always treated us respectfully. \n\nThe album creation process was a nightmare. The first version looked like a high school yearbook. It was very cut and paste. There were cut - off faces and repeated photos. We felt like very little time was put into it. Of course we didn't want to anger the people designing our book, so we complimented some of the layering effects on the pages and requested more pages like that. That's when they told us those pages were the work of a designer they 'outsourced' to. That was fine, but then they told us if we wanted changes, we would have to pay more so they could pay the designer! That was a total surprise, not stated in our contract, and very frustrating since we'd already paid $5600, in full, by the date of our wedding months earlier.  We ended up paying more to get our album, we had no choice! \n\nBottom line--Heather is the wife, very nice lady who was polite and kind to our families at the wedding. Gino seemed to be more focused on their business of teaching other photogs to shoot weddings, rather than focusing on the weddings of their clients. I wish I would've followed my gut instincts when Gino seemed persnickety to begin with. Would've saved us a lot of time and drama. (BTW, Gino refused to show us an example of a wedding he shot from start to finish, which was standard procedure among every other photographer we contacted. Brides: It's good to ask to see that because you get a better sense of the photographer's style and how they capture things throughout your whole wedding day, not just a collection of greatest hits from different weddings. Also, be sure to ask about album design, who does it, and any hidden charges down the line.)\n\nP.S. Gino called me everything from \bridezilla\"" to \""she didn't like us because we weren't Chinese\"" (I'm not Chinese) after I posted my review. But let me reiterate, the photos were beautiful, Heather was very nice, it's just that we felt pretty beleaguered during the album design and we hope SBP takes greater care in the future and learns from the experience just like we did.""",PG8BlZL1,3521

Lunch came with a very thin slice of bread. Bread was excellent but no butter. Server/bartender was made aware and out came a the smallest portion of butter I have ever been served and to be shared with all three of us. There was enough to cover half a Triscut wafer! Pasta was fresh, but without any meat. \n\nThe atmosphere is dark and we were told that it was to be an Italian diner. What added to the dark side was the art work.

2381,2018-04-08 04:36:51,"This review is composed as a companion piece to the other positives on this page, so please read those for details I won't repeat.\n   I think Jason B.'s comments most accurately mirror my overall feel for this place. And, while I find Nick S.'s opinions undeservedly harsh, they do contain kernels of truth that shouldn't be entirely dismissed either.\n   Regarding cleanliness: I contend that Tony's operates on the \European Standard\"". So ,if you've ever been, you know. If your home has anti-bacterial soap pumps at every sink, you carry antiseptic wipes in your purse or on your person at all times, and you fixate on the illusion of a 100% microbe-free world, you may want to \""pass\"" on visiting Tony's. I'd assume then, that you would also avoid any contact with street vendors and food stalls in places like Mexico, Madrid, Bangkok, Hong Kong, et al? Yeah, we're all free to set limits on our individual tolerances, but at what cost to the fullest enjoyment of all that our one, single, lifetime has to offer? Scorpions on a stick, anyone? Perhaps a chilled brewski for starters. Do you do calamari, or not?\n   If you're of the more adventurous sort, at least poke your nose into Tony's for the cultural experience. I consider this place a bona-fide living history museum, with a least three generations of family in evidence, and at your service. Want the lights on in the grocery? Ask. Have a question about ANYTHING? Ditto.\n   Also, take time to see the mementos, memorabilia, kitsch, and exotic products liberally displayed on,behind ,and above the counter and entry. Yeah, there IS dust, but for me that doesn't diminish the faded, festive charm in the least. Nor does it alter the palpable sense of eras past, and present, that this place evokes in me. See the vintage ('50's?) black and white photo of Elvis w/some past friend or relation. Or, more currently, the color shot of, and shout out from, the entire Orangewood Cheer Squad of '09.\n   I admit that not everything at Tony's is superfine, or to everyone's particular taste. I don't especially care for the coarse grind of their sausage, for example, but the sliced meats and cheeses are very good, and well priced. I WOULD recommend checking expire dates on groceries, since the turnover on these items is unknown. I've found outdated items at AJ's, Fry's, and  almost everywhere else.  It happens.\n   If you're up for a purchase, let you senses (and common sense) be your guide. I \""second\"" the votes for the subs, and the standard size, traditional cannoli @$2.15 is a bargain. (compared to $7 at Aiello's restaurant on Central, which I haven't tried.)\n   Another bargain here is the bulk olives. While I'm not a big fan of green or kalamata types by themselves, a good tapenade is always welcome. With jumbo plain greens @$3.50lb., and Greeks priced at the upper end of $5.49lb., you can pay $11 and up for the same thing elsewhere. Let the Snoot in you decide.\n\n   To wrap, YOU NEED TO KNOW about their SICILIAN olives.\nThey're black. They're ripe. They're wrinkled, and dry-cured, and shiny. They're salty,(very) not sour. They're earthy, deeply rich, and complex. They're meaty, satisfying, and delicious. They're addicting. They're sprinkled with fennel seed, red pepper flakes, and (on a good day) bits of fresh garlic. They conjure Mediterranean breezes, raven-haired maidens in aprons, and hillsides with goats. They're seaspray and sunshine; they're sublime. And they're $4.49. Match with a favorite wine, a crusty loaf, a chunk of cheese, and you're home.. Where the heart is... OR, you can eat them like candy. Try at least ONE in your lifetime.\n   Sadly, Tony's skips the minced garlic more often than not. If your purchase comes without, I strongly encourage you to add your own at home. Makes a world of difference.""",3cmFKZ4l,383

In this instance, I like this place.\n\nWild Thaiger is located a few blocks north of the Heard Museum.  As such, it's wonderfully convenient to go here for a bite then wander down to see some American Indian history and artwork.  This was exactly what brought me there last night.\n\nI was seated immediately upon arrival.  The server cheerily came over and, when my first beer selection was out, suggested a few options that I might also enjoy.  I like getting suggestions on food and drink from people who obviously have some knowledge and care about the subject.  I was not disappointed.  The Thai beer I had was wonderful.  Unsurprisingly, much better than the standard American swill.\n\nBeing that this was my first time here, I had to order something from the house specials section.  I decided on the Jungle Love (insert 70s funk music here).  A dish of primarily \exotic\"" vegetables and thin sliced wild boar in a very spicy red broth.  It was superb.  The boar, which I'd never had before, was not the core of the dish but still quite flavorful.  It added a great contrast to the mass of vegetables in the pot.  I'll be honest, I'm not sure half of what I ate in there, but it was all good.  Good, and spicy.  Not the immediate burn you get from some hot food, but the seething heat that only makes you sweat and your lips burn when you're more than half done.  It was exquisite.""",Not5WMVm,2977

I bought tangelos and organic apples from this place and ate all my fruit within the same night. They have an incredible array of organic, vegetarian and vegan foods all at reasonable prices. I have been trying my best to go organic, even trying to eat vegetarian and find it difficult to do with so many tasteless options. Sunflower Market was able to provide even more than expected for my vegetarian meals. Also weird side note, I am a huge fan of garbanzo beans and find a lot of places have \eh\"" garbanzo beans, wow, these are yummy. I threw them in a vegetable soup I also bought from there, super good! I also purchased some organic beauty products and hemp lotion. They had stuff I haven't seen anywhere else. Lots of what they had smelled wonderful, not just the herbal scent a lot of natural products I have used tend to have.

2396,2018-05-28 14:48:01,"Many years ago I had some not so good experiences with Firestone shops and have avoided them since.  Luckily for me one of my tires decided to all but blow up (tread flapping loudly but amazingly air still in the tire), very near this shop.  \n\nI drove the half block from where I'd pulled over to check the damage, noisily slap slap slapping the whole way, my friend telling me there was no way I was going to make it before the tire went totally flat.  The tire held, as I knew it would, and we pulled into the Firestone. \n\nOnce inside I had to wait only a few minutes before Chad, the very pleasant store manager, came over to see what I needed.  At that time all I wanted was to have the spare put on and the mangled tire zipped up in the spare tire purse.  (What are those things called?) \n\nTo my surprise he had a technician pull my car in and take care of it right away.  We were only there for about 15 minutes, it would have been much less time had the poor guy not had so much trouble getting the tread flapping tire all zipped up.  To my even greater surprise when I went to pay, Chad said, \No charge\"".  Okay, starting to kinda like this place.  Nice customer service.\n\nWhen I got home and begin pricing tires I was again surprised to find that Firestone was only a little bit more for comparable tires than the other big Discount tire place nearby.  I decided to spend the extra $8 at the Firestone because of the great customer service I received.  Oh maybe that was their plan all along..go figure.\n\nI went back in armed with my internet prices and knew exactly what tires I wanted and how much it should cost.  Justin, the brand new shop manager, (He literally just got to Phoenix the day before, welcome to Phoenix Justin) greeted me when I came in even though he was helping another customer.  \n\nWhen he was free he looked up the tires I wanted and informed me they needed to be ordered but he could have them in less than an hour.  I couldn't wait due to an appointment I had later in Chandler.  I had Justin order the tires so they would be there the next day.  \n\nI asked Justin if they were the same as the on line price, he verified that they were and I said I'd hoped they'd be even less.  He promised to see if he could do anything about that when I came in the next day.\n\nThe next afternoon I dropped off my car and waited at Manuels Mexican restaurant a block away (Great Mexican food and Ritas).  It took a bit longer than expected but I didn't really care.  \n\nWhen I got back to pick up my car Justin went a step beyond his word and somehow managed to get me a great deal on the tires, including the road hazard.  He also had my car fully checked out and told me that I didn't need anything else, my car was in good shape.  \n\nNo up selling, no trying to get me to buy an air filter or another service I didn't need.  He had told me that it was his policy to never sell a customer something they do not need and then proved it by giving my car a clean bill of health.  \n\nSo, if you are in the North Valley and need work done on your car, think there might be something wrong, or you need new tires go see Chad and Justin.  They are amazing and run a great shop!  \n\nI was going to give them only 4 stars with a mention that I would give them 4.5 is possible but after writing this I think I'm going with the 5 since they are closer to a 4.75.  Seriously, go see them!""",UmcAF5Zk,638
2397,2018-02-17 02:57:26,"Came here because my niece was having her baby girl on june 4th. All of the nurses were very accomodating and nice in the delivery room.

Everyone was very professional yet very flexible at the same time. Everybody who was not in the delivery room had to go into the waiting room. I snuck back in and put my ear to the door so I could hear the delivery and they never said anything. And there was a big sign next to my head that said \go to the waiting room. no waiting allowed in the halls\"" The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have little mitts for the babies hands to prevent her from scratching her eyes which she did a couple times.

Fajitas are an American food, Tex-Mex to be exact. Your GPS is smarter than you.  They originated in Texas in the 30's and 40's by Mexican cowhands working on Texas ranches.  The American ranch owners would give the Mexican cowboys (vaqueros) the scraps of slaughtered cattle they thought were unusable, one of those scraps was the skirt steak that is still used today in Fajitas. \n\nGo to Mexico and try to order Fajitas at a restaurant, they will laugh at you.

The shrimp is great quality and perfectly grilled to bring out its natural sweet flavor. I also love the robust veggie filling, including sauteed spinach, onions and peppers - the spinach is especially flavorful and a unique addition for sure. My only gripe with the tacos (and this is just a personal thing) is that each comes with two corn tortillas, which appears to be necessary to hold the hearty fillings but is a little carb-heavy for my tastes. \n\nBut who I am I kidding?

For example, the sesame one tastes great drizzled on top of the shrimp tacos, and the peanut one was really solid with the chips. Both Asian-seeming sauces. Both surprisingly great matches for the savory Mexican flavors. \n\nThe final thing I wanted to mention is the Jamaica (pronounced Huh-my-kah) drink, which is essentially sweetened hibiscus tea.

My sister was not in love with her poblano chile torta. It was oozing with cheese and she didn't think it had a \""meaty\"" quality to make for a good sandwich. The bread it came out on, a crusty French loaf, was an interesting touch and good. \n\nWould I come back? Yes. Would I tell others to go? Absolutely. Will I go on a Saturday night? No. I hate waiting an hour for a table so will go when I don't have to do that. Problem solved.""",DvBSr46C,4901

If you want a P.P.

My family seemed to enjoy their steak and chicken salad, but the \""extras\"" (1/3-of-a-corn-on-the cob and baked beans) left a lot to be desired.  \n\nOne thing I was a bit surprised by was that I have been to several steakhouses before, but each seemed to have one thing on the menu for non-meat eaters like a veggie burger or a pasta dish that could be made w/out meat.

Around noon it was surprisingly not busy inside (maybe we missed the rush), and the nice lady inside directed us to take a seat and got our drinks started for us. After looking at the menu, I decided to get a combo, with half ceasar salad and bistro club sandwich. My bf ended up getting the Reuben.  There is just one woman behind the counter, so I can imagine what the wait would be like if it was busy, but it was just as couple of minutes before our sandwiches came out. \n\nThey were awesome and provided the dressing on the side of my salad, which was cool.

My panini though was really good, and my bf described his sandwich as \excellent\"". The server was great the entire time, and you can tell they are proud of what they put out. \n\nThe only thing to keep in mind is parking is rough if you're their for lunch (we had to drive around a bit before finding a spot).

That said the experience here was pretty awkward and uncomfortable. \n\nUpon arriving and not seeing a huge crowd, we were told that it would be an hour and fifteen minute wait. We said ok, we'd like to check the bar. She rudely told us that it was full and gave my fiance the stink eye when he left. I trusted her and waited for him to come back.

Really not cool. Really bad for business. \n\nAnywho... seeing as my fiance wasn't back I guessed correctly that he scored us some bar seats. And there were two more down a ways. Full my ass. It was like she was trying to turn away business so she could leave early. It was only 8pm too!\n\nEnter bartender... or ID Nazi. My fiance is 33 and rarely, if ever carded. No biggie, but the guy was kind of abrupt and not friendly. He then had a really awkward interaction with a girl that worked there. He was reprimanding her but did it in a very rude way. Not what I want to see. \n\nIt took forever for us to put in our order and after we got our food and another employee came to sit down next to us we got the full brunt of bad juju at the restaurant.

I don't want to hear about it while I'm trying to relax.

2530,2018-05-15 02:44:25,"I just got back from lunch at this place today.  I've been to many places in the downtown area for lunch (I work in the area), and this was, in my opinion, by far my worst experience eating lunch at a downtown establishment.  \n\nWe arrived at the restaurant at about 11:50 a.m.  I arrived with my party, a group of 5, and nobody else was waiting in line.  As the waitress (they don't have any hosts/hostesses) was trying to figure out how to accomodate our group of 5, she seated the group of 2  that came in from behind us.  No big deal - that was a more typical number for them to seat.\n\nAbout a minute later, she sat us next to the cash register.  Next to us were two ladies who had ordered their food to go and were still waiting.  I had overheard one of the ladies comment to the other lady wondering what was taking their food so long.  An omen of things to come.\n\nWe received water fairly quickly, then was given soup before we ordered.  The soup was fine compared to similar establishments, although it only had tofu in it rather than maybe one or two pieces of chicken.\n\nWe ordered our food: two orders of drunken noodles; one spicy green bean with chicken, one ginger chicken with brown rice, and I ordered the spicy eggplant with brown rice.  Not a complicated order.  Especially when considering the menu is simple: they have like 14-16 lunch specials, and the only difference in price is whether or not you order a different kind of protein.  It's cookie cutter, generic Thai food.  We ordered at around 11:55 a.m.\n\nMy group and I are all friends, so we were conversing for awhile without thinking about how long it was taking.  By about 12:25 p.m. we were wondering what was going on.  I looked over to the table to my right, which is a table of 10 right next to the storefront window of the restaurant.  A group of 10 people that had been seated after us had already gotten their food and were in the process of paying their checks.  I then saw the group of 2 who were seated just before us finishing up their meals as well.  Not a good sign.\n\nAt about 12:30 p.m., I got up from my seat and asked the lady at the cash register if we were going to be getting our meals anytime soon.  She asked me where I was seated, noticed I came from right around the corner of the register, didn't really answer me, turned around to some people and started speaking in a different language to either the cooks or the other waitresses.  I sat back down and she darted by shortly thereafter saying 5 more minutes.\n\nNow I was checking my phone constantly.  At 12:38, two orders came out: one of the drunken noodles and the spicy green bean with chicken.  My two friends began eating, as we had already been waiting for so long.  Two more orders came out at 12:40: the other drunken noodle and the ginger chicken.  I looked to my right: the group of 10 had gotten up and walked out of the restaurant.  I then got my dish.  Needless to say, I was not happy.\n\nAs we hurriedly scarfed down our food, we asked for the check.  We noticed that the two dishes that had ordered brown rice received an additional $2 charge, when the menu said $1.  I immediately darted up from my seat and went to the cashier and notified her of the problem.  To her credit, she fixed it immediately.\n\nI then started eating my food.  Considering I had to wait over 45 minutes for it, it was not even all that hot - temperature or spice wise.  I bit into several pieces of eggplant that were still cold - like the stirfry hadn't gotten all the freezer burn out of it just quite, and now it was just cold instead of frozen.  I had also asked for it to be spicy hot, and it wasn't even close to even being mild spicy.  For a dish that is supposed to be \spicy eggplant\"" and I ordered it hot: well, it wasn't particularly authentic Thai spicy.\n\nWe asked them to split the check five ways by giving the cashier 5 credit cards (which is just the norm for downtown joints these days).  I asked her why our order took so long and why a table that had 10 people seated after us were able to get their food, eat, and pay before we even received our dishes.  The only answer I got was thank you for being patient, and that the group of 10 had called in their order.  There were no apologies, and no credit to our meals offered.  It then took them a long time to get us our checks.\n\nThe service here was ridiculous.  Apparently, they treat people who call in their orders with more priority than other guests.  (And yet, many take out orders waited near us). That's not quite a solution for a poorly run restaurant.  Nor was the food all that great either.  I will not be coming back here, and I would advise that anyone else interested in a normal length lunch not even bother either.  But if you don't care that your order comes out 45 minutes after you order it during lunch, you get overcharged for items you ordered, and enjoy subpar non-authentic food, well then by all means, go ahead and come here.""",3JXAqypz,4033

Their turkey burger, protein style, is perfect here at the PHX location.  I had one at their Scottsdale location and it was underseasoned to say the least.  Their cod dish is delicious.  When they serve himachi as their \raw fish of the day\"", it was perfect.  I'm also a fan of their sweet potato hash.  The chicken chopped salad is good.  And, last but not least, their mushroom pizza is to die for.""",V3jeGey9,2304

2551,2018-01-04 03:17:18,"Who knew in midst all of the Mexican restaurants, you'd find a diamond in the rough for Chinese food.  Arizona doesn't have many Chinese restaurants to begin with, however this place rivals the places in CA.  It's not the place for ambience or mood, but the food is the most important for the Chinese and this place is great for dinner or dim sum.  \n \nNotes for ordering dishes:\nI loved the garlic pea sprouts/shoots.  Not all Chinese restaurants this vegetable, but this place makes have it fresh and crunchy and just enough garlic flavor to give it that extra pizzazz.  What I noticed is that this place serves unique fried noodles.  Perfect for vegetarians, this place actually cooked crispy fried noodles unlike most other Chinese restaurant that just comes out with soggy noodles.  Another dish I recommend is their spiced salt tofu. (jiao yan tofu).  Well anything with the spiced salt (jiao yan).  They deep fry the small pieces of tofu or whatever other \jiao yan\"" producing a crunchy crust and mix it with a salty seasoning and jalapenos.  Great for an appetizer!  My family and I also had their steamed whole fish.  Light flavor and prepared beautifully with the entire moist fish out on the table.  Just the sauce and rice alone tastes just as good.  Be sure to try their walnut shrimp.  Be sure you have a big mouth to fit one of these jumbo shrimp in one bite.  The sauce covering the shrimp has just the right amount of tanginess and sweetness that I'm looking for without being too thick.  And the sweet crunchy walnut complements the dish as well.\nOrdering the right dishes can make or break your experiences.  For this restaurant, be sure to pick seafood, their specialty.  They have live fish, crabs, etc in clear tanks so you can pick out your dinner victim.  And of course pick fried anything, especially with their spiced salt (jiao yan).\n\nNotes for dim sum:\nGreat Wall actually has a unique set of dim sum choices that you can't find anywhere in the valley (at least the Chinese dim sum places I've been to).  Although it's a bit more expensive than the other places in the valley I've been to, but it does taste better overall.  Even the basic dim sum dishes like shrimp dumplings, shumai, and chicken feet simply taste better and I would even say taste better than some CA restaurant.  Who'd thought?  Because the dishes are small, you can try many of them and of course I would go for the fried stuff.  :-) However be careful.  Keep your eye out for the moving carts, if what you want has been sitting there for a while, wait for a new batch.  Cold Chinese food just doesn't taste as well.  Only the tin dishes that are covered are fine, because their still hot after the servers make their rounds.  Go on the weekend for a wider selection and be prepared to have a wait.  But the wait isn't that bad compared to some places I've been to in CA.  Great to go with a medium sized party so you can taste more variety, but not have to wait a long time for a table.\n\nOverall, this is a great place to get great Chinese food if you live in the valley and don't want to make a 6hr journey to LA just for good Chinese food (which I have done before).""",HctC9VYg,4916

The glass enclosed wine room is the centerpiece and is quite beautiful.  No expense was spared on the decor and furniture.  The bar had live jazz music and the dining room was bustling with activity.  We started with the Shellfish Tower which reminded me quite a bit of the Ocean Club Seafood Tower.  I had the Pacific Ahi Tuna as my main course.  It was delicious!  The seafood was top quality and the presentation made it even more special.  The service was good although there were some issues with the availability of wine from the wine list.  The experience was memorable and also expensive for my date.  If you dine here,XHr2RMcF,1313
2555,2018-02-04 03:12:09,"The women of AZRD (Arizona Roller Derby) rock, and rock hard!  AZRD is a local roller derby organization, of about 3 in the state and they are amazing to watch.  They are a member of the \Women's Flat Track Derby Association\"".  So if you saw the \""Roller girls\"" series on TV, it's not quite like that as it's all flat - not raised up on the outside.  The biggest advantage here is that it's much easier for them to find a space to both practice and perform.  \n\nThere are 4 teams in the league, and they all have great names - and super fun outfits that \""match\"" their name.  Example, we love the Surly Gurlies - and they are all pirate costumes. And most of those include fishnets.  Did that get anyone's attention?  Yea, they have to use a bit of sex to initially get the butts in the seats, but after watching one of their bouts, most folks are ready to go again just for the action. \n\nAnd this isn't like the fake stuff you saw on TV years ago.  This is totally real un-choreographed stuff.   And if you want to join, as long as you have your own insurance and a pair of skates - you're welcome to join their \""Smash Squad\"" to learn the ropes until you're good enough to be picked up by one of the teams.  \n\nIt's really a great time. Energy is always high and it's a great chance to yell and scream like a fool too.  If you want to - not required of course.  \n\nThe only negative has been their announcers.  They had some good ones a few times, but often we can't hear what in the heck they are saying.  Maybe one day they'll be able to afford a PA system we can understand.\n\nFinal Bonus - There's always a live band to play between each of their sets.  This could be rock, bunk, ska, rockabilly or something else wonderful and amazing.  And occasionally loud.  There are usually ear plugs available at the door for their indoor bouts.  Take them up on it.  Trust me.""",sldsbyQq,2538
2556,2018-04-02 14:21:10,"We went here for my sister/husband 11th anniversary dinner.  First time for all of us.  The place is located in what looks like business buildings near Biltmore.  Parking is ample for evening dinner.\n\nThe restaruant has a nice bar and was dressed to the 9's.  The hostess and servers were both very polite, which one would expect in an upscale restaurant.  Sissy's husband let them know it was their anniversary when he called in reservations, so there were little confetti hearts on the table.\n\nThe server suggested a great bottle of wine to go with dinner.  The other 3 in our party ordered a meal that comes with soup/salad, entree,  2 sides, and tiny dessert selections.  They run about $39-$50 depending on the entree.   We all had steak - duh, steakhouse - and the sides ranged from mashed potatoes, asparagus, sauteed mushrooms, and potato augratin.  The sides are large enough to share.  Everything tasted delicious.  The server finished the meal by serving a tiny creme brulee and chocolate mousse selection with the words \happy anniversary\"" on the plate.\n\nOverall, nice experience.  We went at the elderly people's dinner time of 5 pm, so the place was dead @ opening.  It picked up businesses around 630-7pm.  Nice place to celebrate birthday, anniversary.""",WRJGnWVe,2499

They have a lot of other stuff, too. I just get the tacos. 6 of them, because they are tiny. \n\nThey have TVs for watching Futbol, a game of pool will run you 50cents and they have 3 video games in addition to a jukebox.

I felt that I was paying way too much but was in a time crunch so I accepted and left (did not get an actual copy of any shipping forms because she said she had to keep all copies including the one that says \customer copy\""). \n\nOnce my package arrived my feeling of being overcharged was confirmed.  Of the $136 I paid for postage and insurance, it only really cost $77 to send. Upon contacting the owner, I was told there was no error and the +75% markup was the retail price because they have no affiliation with UPS and thats how they earn money to stay in business.

Then again, what can you expect from a student-grade art supplier?  \n\nI used Utrecht acrylics to paint a large-scale mural (one of my first painting commissions).  The colors aren't as pure or as concentrated as Golden Paints (my preferred line), and there's a very limited selection of acrylic mediums. They get the job done, but they're prone to fading and chipping. \n\nBack to the store itself....\n\nEverything is crammed into a tiny space. Their brush selection is very limited; they don't stock artist grade brushes (except I did fall in love with this varnish brush...but it's a f*ing varnish brush).

They stock papers, stretcher bars (very limited selection), pens, modeling materials, and rolls of canvas.  I didn't have patience to roam through the five aisles because it was so crammed with ASU students. \n\nMy real qualm is the staff.  They aren't the most experienced or knowledgeable bunch.  I asked about the uses of a particular brush and was told \I don't know.\""  The person who did know wasn't enthusiastic and didn't seem to have much artistic experience.  At a store like this, a customer should never know more than the staff.  I'm no Van Gogh (cliche, I know), nor am I an artistic scholar, but I actually use these products. The staff apparently does not. OH, but they did tell me about a free club one can join to get 10% off of non-sale items, making many products cheaper than at other art supply stores.  \n\nVisit Jerry's Artarama down the street (Rural and the 60) and then tell me what you think of Utrecht.""",e2O9r5iZ,2726

2617,2018-06-06 04:38:45,"We began our dinner by being seated in an area with ongoing construction, so while we were studying the menu we already enjoyed a generous portion of drill noise and sawdust. The restaurant in general looked like a crossover of wannabe-hip Athenian nightclub and American sports bar. Drinks: I was originally drawn here because one of the reviewers on yelp complained about having only Greek wines to choose from. Having spent many summers in Greece I love Greek wine, however at MBFG I was sorely disappointed because I was unable to find Retsina on the menu. While two people in my group went for a glass of Kretikos (at a staggering price of $7 each) and got a huge glass filled with a little bit of wine, I went for the Passion Fruit Iced Tea, which tasted decent and was huge, however it was watered down by the berg of ice it came with. We also got some water, which tasted as if the aforementioned construction was also going on in their pipes. Food: It might be that my standards for Greek food are too high, but to me MBFG was trying to be authentic and failed big time. Our waitress was very nice and helpful, however she was Albanian and had never heard the actual Greek names of the food. Asked if their village hummus was like fava, she responded by telling us of what hummus consisted. And while it is nice that they had three different kinds of hummus on their \MBFG dips\"" platter, I feel the need to point out that hummus isn't really Greek but Arabic. I wish they had offered some skordalia, fava and/or melitzanosalata instead. This would have also solved my second problem with the platter, which was that I was pretty sure that at least half of their dips were not made at MBFG, which is sad considering that they charged $14 for it. Our entrees were huge, we had both the Gyro and the Souvlaki platters. Sadly the highlight wasn't the meat but the small side of potatoes that was the only authentic tasting food I had here and the saving grace for MBFG. The gyro while OK tasting was not authentic and didn't come with enough Tzatziki. The Souvlaki was well seasoned, however it was covered in a strange white sauce instead of the traditional (and much more delicious) lemon juice. For $13 I would have also expected more than two skewers and some actual tomato rice on the side instead of the strange rice they served. Needless to say we left without ordering dessert and won't return. If you want Greek food go elsewhere, the only thing Greek about MBFG is their background music.""",K5i2dYKJ,4270

2658,2018-05-25 09:07:18,"I remodeled my home in Tempe AZ in late 2008.  It is a little late to post a review on the service I received during that harrowing experience.  I guess it is enough to say that I have a stack of receipts over an inch thick!  I've kept returning to the place for lots of stuff.  I would like to share my experience purchasing and owning some major appliances.  The extended warranty.  And a example of service that sets this Lowe's apart from the rest of the big box stores.  \n\nI purchased set of Kitchenaid stainless steel appliances.  A nice refrigerator,  the best dishwasher I've ever used, a nice electric range/oven, and a problematic microwave/convection oven.   Just to be safe my wife in her infinite wisdom included an extended warranty in the budget.  We never purchased extended warranties in the past, we depended on the quality of the appliances and the reputation of the manufacturer.    \n\nI researched appliances and decided on the Kitchenaid brand as affordable, attractive, functional, and reliable.  They are attractive and had the features we wanted.  Lowes made them affordable.  The reliability part not so much.  \n\nThe microwave was the first to go sixteen months after our purchase. The third party extended warranty company was a little hard to work with.  After several trips to the appliance doctor the technicians gave up and declared the unit dead.  The warranty company replaced the unit, minus delivery, installation.  Plus they would only provide a Lowes gift card for the amount I paid for the microwave.  Of course when we bought  four appliances the cost was less than a single unit.  The gift card was a couple of hundred bucks short of replacement.  Did they live up the fine print on the warranty?  Yes.  Did they annoy us, waste our time, and unnecessarily annoy us?  Yes.  \n\nWhen an appliance dies it is a process.  From my standpoint I'm disappointed, and inconvenienced.   We used the microwave and convection oven on a daily basis.  We had a backup oven but no microwave.  The repair company took the microwave for several days at a time.  When the device returned it would work for a few days, or weeks and something else would go wrong. Each time Steve the manager at Lowes rose to the occasion and lent us a microwave!  Then when the gift card was short he sold us a new microwave at the cost of the gift card delivered it and installed it.  Kudos to Steve for understanding that our purchase of the appliances and extended warranty were from Lowes.  He stood behind the appliance as well as the third party warranty.  \n\nGood service is consistent at this Lowes!    This month the refrigerator began it's downward spiral.  The same third party warranty company send techs from a different service company this time.  The refrigerator seems to have a mind of it's own and stops working, or the ice misses the ice bucket and falls to the bottom of the freezer compartment.  Then the lights don't go on and it doesn't cool.  The techs have performed surgery and replaced several components.  This last issue required replacement of the \main board\"" .  Of course this happened when we purchased some great steaks, and lots of fresh veggies and fruit.  The thing was stuffed!  You can imagine how worried I was when I opened the fridge and found the butter was soft!  \n\nI can only imagine the nightmare if I didn't work from home most of the time.  They give four hour windows for service.  I would have had to take a half day off from work four different times for this fridge service.  The lost productivity from work would more than pay for the extended warranty.  Something to consider in your next appliance purchase.  \n\nTrue to Murphys law, this happened on a Friday.  The tech said the parts warehouse would expedite the part but the appliance would not be reliable.  I asked what expedite meant.  He said he didn't know.  Points to the tech for honesty.   To my mind expedite means overnight the part withe Saturday delivery and install it the same day it arrives.  Here is is Monday afternoon and I have not heard anything about the part or when my fridge will be repaired.  But all is not lost.  Again I called Steve the manager at Lowes.  He listened to the problem.  I probably should have been less forceful in my delivery.  After all it was not Lowes that was the problem.  They didn't make the appliances, or service them.  Here is is four years after the sale.  \n\nI explained that the repair company left us with a fridge that was not reliable.  He stepped up again and offered a loaner which was at my house in a couple of hours.  A huge sigh of relief.  \n\nI am happy to shop at this Lowes.  When I have problems they help me solve them.  On my appliance purchase I investigated the appliances, and made what I thought was a good choice.  My genius wife added the extended warranty.  Lowes stood behind the purchase and helped out a great deal when the appliances quit  working.  I am lucky to be surrounded by these smart peop""",9tshDFMk,514

2670,2018-02-18 14:41:02,"Not being a big fan of Chinese food myself, I decided to humor my partner in crime and try something of her choosing this Friday evening. After hearing my parents and food snob brother rant about the one in Avondale, I figured being a chain, it couldn't be much worse (or better) at this location.\n\nSince I was hungry (having not eaten all day due to my sensitive piercing [see my review for HTC]) we ordered 2 apps (edamame and the chicken lettuce wraps), for our entrees she had the Kung Pao chicken while I had the Thai coconut curry shrimp.\n\nThe edamame came out pretty quickly, but were kinda \over-reheated\"" although fairly tasty. The lettuce wraps were OK. While the lettuce was great and very crisp and fresh, the chicken mixture was a little overdone and underseasoned. I've had better lettuce wraps at BJ's, to be totally honest.\n\nOut came the entrees and again, nothing special, but not bad. The chicken in her entree was, again, a little overcooked but not enough to make it inedible...I personally thought they were a little stingy with the peanuts, but the flavor was OK. Enough heat to make the dish enjoyable but not hot enough that you would start sweating profusely.\n\nMy coconut curry shrimp smelled delicious and tasted the same. They definitely aren't stingy with the protein in either entree we tried. My only gripe with my entree was that it came out a little on the cool side, and without seeing any visible peppers, the seasoning throughout was a little inconsistent...a few bites would have no heat at all, then I'd fish out a shrimp and chomp away and I'd be in tears due to the spice.\n\nSo, I wouldn't say it was good enough to change my opinion of Chinese food, but it was definitely a nice change of pace and I would go back again. 4 stars down to 3 as the cashier/order taker was a little snotty and impatient for my taste.""",ArXvNL1Q,3127

I love trying new places, so I was game.\n\nThe place was busy on a Saturday night, but it didn't take too long for us to get our order. At Cafe Rio you have to stand in line, and then they assemble the food right in front of you--kind of Subway-style, but much, much better than Subway.

So far, so good. My sis's Shrimp Tacos (breaded, fried shrimp) were, as promised, VERY good. My burrito...? Well, it was okay. The Barbacoa had a sweet taste to it I wasn't prepared for, and the \""hot\"" sauce I had them put in my burrito was not very hot at all. That would have been a nice balance to the sweet, but it wasn't meant to be. The tortilla was freshly made though, and the other ingredients in the burrito were tasty. I just made a bad meat choice for me. You may like it if you prefer your burrito to have a \""Manwich\"" type flavor. I do not.\n\nOverall, I liked the place. I still enjoyed my sweet-tasting burrito, and I helped myself to some of my sis's tacos [again, I'm not the guy you want to sit next to at dinner].

(That's right, SNL Robert Goulet reference) \n\nWhen the weather's nice, I spend as much of my time outdoors as I possibly can. I look at it like the camel filling himself with water for his desert hike, or the bear filling his belly with food for a long winter of hibernation because I know that when July and August hits...I'll be merely dreaming about the outdoors. So, Piestewa Peak (formerly known as Squaw Peak) is one of my favorite outdoor destinations. \n\nOk, so there are a couple routes you can take at Piestewa Peak and that's what I love about this area. If you're in the cardio mood, you can climb the peak and get the stair master workout. When you get to the rocky top, it's pretty awesome staring out and seeing the city on one side and a desert preserve on the other. \n\nIf you're in the mood for a flatter hike through the desert oasis itself, then park in the way back and take the path you see on the north side. Between the saguaros and the rolling peaks and valleys, it's a gorgeous hike. You could easily keep walking until the sun sets so keep an eye on the clock and remember the direction you took. As long as you do that, you're golden. There are several different paths you can take including some with lookouts, some that go deep into the valley and some that explore the ups and downs of the preserve. So be sure to do your research and figure out which path you want to take. \n\nHiker be warned!! You know how they also warn you to never leave the beaten path? Well... I didn't listen...and when I didn't listen, a jumping cactus decided to show me how it earned the name \jumping cactus\"" by jumping right onto my ankle. With nothing but water and a lone backpack, we had to improvise ways to get the needles out of my ankle. Now here's a little tid bit of knowledge about the jumping cactus...when it attaches to let's say, you're leg, it hooks in and makes it pretty darn hard to get out. Ten painful prick removals later, I was back on board and a little sore, but kept on truckin'. So be warned and keep a solid eye out for any little cacti lying around, because they are everywhere on Piestewa Peak. But don't let that scare you!

I had to see what the fuss was about.\nI'm very impressed. This is my new favorite burger spot. They have normal size burgers (i.e. huge) as well as mini versions. I got a mini because I'm watching my figure and it was the perfect size burger for me. The burger comes naked as a Jaybird. If you want something on it (and they have quite a list of toppings) you have to specify. The burger was one of the best I've ever had in my life. Perhaps it was the grilled onions and mushrooms. \nThe cajun fries were smothered in spice and made my tongue sweat. I liked it! (\Small\"" must mean \""enormous.\"" Get a small and you can easily split it was a friend or two.)\nFive Guys wasn't any more pricey than any other burger spot around town. The mini burger and small cajun fries came to $6.50 ish. (No drink for me. I only drink water, and that's always free.)\nI'm only going here for burgers from now on.

Fours stars for 'decent'?\"" \nWell, let me explain. \n\n17 years ago, I was ripped from the pizza haven that was my first home (after the womb, but just as comfortable), Long Island, NY. The reasons are unclear to me still. I was a vulnerable nine year old uprooted and moved to the cruel and often cold (metaphorically, not literally) Sonoran Desert, I had no way to cope with my new surroundings. Oreos just did not fill the void in my empty pit of a stomach, which I was quickly trying to fill with something familiar. \nThat something familiar was a good, thin and crunchy crust, extra sauce, light on the cheese, pie. Pizza pie. \nNo one could provide for me. I was desolate. Pizza places came and went. A sauce here, a sauce there. \n\nEventually I learned to cope on my own without the crutch that was the perfect slice. I live for my semi annual trips back to the pizza- womb that is Greenwich Village, but when I am feeling just a little nostalgic, just a little emotional... a slice from Buono's will suffice. \n\nAnd that is why I give 4 stars.""",GStyFTXi,2491

I'm a JA regular in Michigan and I've been at the  doors every week like a bad Mervyns commercial!!! Open! Open! Open! (kidding). They finally opened today I'm told more busy than expected.  \n\nJ Alexanders serves American-style food with a contemporary twist. They fit somewhere between casual and fine dining and the atmosphere is enhanced by dark woods, indoor/outdoor bar and interesting textures.  For Houstons fans, JA has a strikingly similar atmosphere and menu. Legend has it that the original owners of Houstons split and started JA. I personally like the JA menu better. From the colossal onion rings on the appetizer menu to their always classic and perfectly juicy prime rib.  \n\nYou may see some similarities to Houstons, but don't expect the \famous\"" Houston's spinach dip. JA's is a queso dip (w/ a little spinach).  As I understand it, they try to tweak their menu to regional markets. If that's so, they have to add more flavor to the queso dip. It was terribly lacking in flavor. Folks in this region expect their Southwest style dishes be full of flavor! Kick it up a notch! One friend had the blue cheese topped filet Mignon and another the pork loin...both very good. \n\nThe wine list is reliable and pleasing. Many well known labels integrated with some interesting less known. If you're a lemonade lover (Arnold Palmer for DA kid) try their fresh squeezed. Ah! I tell you....they bust their butts for this simple childhood favorite. \n\nIf you're a carrot cake fan...you've gotta have it! \n\nMy friends and I sat at the bar to watch some Monday night football and our servers Chris and Brittany were friendly and attentive.

2730,2018-06-08 19:12:37,I dined at Lo-Lo's for the 1st time this past Sunday. I called ahead after leaving church to make reservations for a party of 5. I was told our wait would be 20 mins. By the time our party was there & spoke to the girl at the podium. We were told that the person that answered the phone NEVER relayed the message to the person who actually keeps the list & gets the guests seated. Needless to say we waited about 45 mins & watched as several other groups of people who also called ahead were forced to wait among those walking up. Although we didn't mind the waiting; it was a lil discomforting to have that happen. Once we did get inside service was prompt & our order taken immediately. One of our guests did have issues with his order. Apparently he always orders an omelettes & we were told that the person who usually does omelettes was not there so he could not get it. He ordered something else & again it was a no-go. That sucked quite a bit but all in all the experience was fun & I definitely wouldn't mind going again.,7YlOTvDp,3374

At all.\n\nI love me some spider crab. Most places it's over cooked and/or gets drowned out by the other flavors in the roll. Not this time. Loads of crab flavor.\n\nAnd the unagi was sublime. I normally pass, as the over-sweet sauce just doesn't cut it for me. But I gave it a shot. Wow. Skip the sauce. Just enjoy the incredible flavor. Wonderful.\n\nTheir rice-less roll (tsunami?) was sublime. Every bite was fresh layered on top of fresh. The tempura battering was light and flakey. Highly recommended.\n\nThe only strikes were selection. Two of the items we ordered weren't available. Not necessarily a bad thing, as I think that speaks to the the freshness. They order enough for the day. And we ate late, so I'm not terribly surprised they were out. \n\nThat, and the under-chef convinced me to forgo the ikura with quail egg in favor of tobikko with quail egg. It was good, and in his defense he offered to not charge me for it if I didn't like it. But I did like it. Just not as much as I would have if I would have capped my meal with the ikura/quail combo. Mine may not be traditional. And it may be heretical. But it's fab. So I'll get that next time and stick to my guns.\n\nBecause, oh yes... we'll be back!""",BSYiKewC,1188

Just ... just so, so light, and fluffy. The crust is crispy and light and buttery. And it costs far less than inferior quiche at other places (about $4, I think).\n\nBut the five stars I gave it aren't just for the quiche, or the rest of the amazing pastries.  This place just does everything right: the location is in a beautiful, historic location; they have a terrific selection of loose-leaf tea; the atmosphere is cool, with worn concrete floors, a high ceiling, and vintage furniture; the staff is friendly, and acts like a family; and a vintage Bang & Olufsen stereo playing music that is far too cool for me to identify it.

Perhaps a night on the town, perhaps an evening at home with a bottle of wine and a good movie.\n\nMe, I'll be hunting down Big Sexy (the best cat EVER, regardless of my husband's opinion).   He senses when I'm coming.  I'll pretend to just be coming to say hello.  He'll know.  He will hunker down, flatten his ears on the back of his head, and foam at the mouth.  First, I'll pry up an ear to apply his \anti-puking\"" medicine to the inside.  Next, I'll pry his mouth open and squirt a shot of the delicious chicken-flavored antibiotic in it.  He'll continue to foam and drool, so I'll hold him down until he's over it.  He'll fake being calm, I'll release him, he'll hobble off (arthritis you know) and resume drooling everywhere and most likely puke up the antibiotic within 2 minutes anyway.\n\nBut the point of my review is I have spoken with several people who have gone through the ritual of trying to get their pet to swallow a pill unnecessarily.  Diamondback specializes in veterinary compounding, so a pill is not always your only option.  Now my Big Sexy is easy to pill, but wouldn't you know it, he's taking medication NOT available in one!\n\nDiamondback would have been 5 stars had they not changed locations from Thomas Rd.  Since the move, it seems like they are disorganized and it's always a fiasco when I pick up.  Hopefully, they'll get it together.

My second clue was the plastic fake Louis Vuitton bags for sale, hanging on the wall. My third was when the employee argued with me about what I wanted -- namely, for my heels to be resoled with something that gives them a little more grip, because 4\ heels + highly polished floor at work have earned me the nickname of \""Cripple\"". I specifically asked that the heel itself get a little something for grip, since that area seemed to be the worst culprit. The man argued with me, saying the heel shouldn't matter. Well, unless you have a secret, big guy, I doubt you have a lot of experience with the treacherous specifics of heels. The fourth clue was when he ran my debit card and the machine ran out of paper and he didn't know if the transaction went through or not.\n\nWhat?\n\nWhen I picked the shoes up, I then had to wait while he flipped through the entire day's transactions from the day I had dropped the shoes off to make sure the payment went through. Why is this my problem? Why do I have to stand there for five minutes while you do that?  \n\nAnd then, next time I wore the heels to work, the heels themselves slipped all over on the floor, just like I thought they would. Sure, the ball of my foot was fine, but that wasn't the problem in the first place. So I spent $15 for nothing. Thanks.""",Mhde6NXd,1851

Sometimes they're able to get what they need, but they've all mentioned the lack of professionalism of this clinic. One friend went there and Dr. Arneson misdiagnosed her with an ear infection without even examining her, and presribed her an antibiotic she didn't need that ended up making her sick.\n\nThe \doctor\"" I saw that day had no idea what she was doing. What I really wanted was a strep throat test. It took her several minutes to even track one down, and it seemed like she had no idea how to administer it. She didn't bother to ask me what I was taking for my sickness - I had to bring it up.  She started going off on her crackpot anti-vaccine beliefs while there was a needle in my arm.  The drip she gave me didn't help at all - I was sick as a dog for another week. On top of that, she charged me more than $120 freaking dollars for my visit, when my friends say they usually get charged $10 or $20.  I could have gone to an urgent care clinic for half that and seen a real doctor, one who actually accepts scientific facts.\n\nThis place is a joke.

I finished it in 5:57. With 3 seconds left to go! So look for my picture gracing the wall for the rest of 2012. The real challenge with that is being able to eat 12 wings in 6 minutes. That is tough enough by itself. I do have to say Teakwoods has hotter wings than here but this is enough to put me in sooo much pain. \n\nWhen I'm not trying to kill myself with blazin wings, I love watching games/fights here. There is a bazillion TV's everywhere. They usually have great drink specials when I'm there and of course I'm tearing up some wings since they are amazing! \n\nEven compared to other BBW in the valley, I feel like the owner makes her staff go above and beyond and I get a better experience here than any other BBW outside of Gilbert. \n\nProtip: If you live in the area, sign up for their text updates and I get messages from them letting me know when they have \extra special\"" specials.""",QRNb0yfU,3697

Until then, I'm glad to be able to skip the wait, especially on a Saturday night.\n\nThe food is very good.  They have some signature \tarts\"" which are basically like a Calazone and/ or a classy pot pie.  I had the Mediterranean-style tart and it was nothing short of being awesome.  Inside the buttery pastry, I uncovered fresh chicken, aromatic basil, and sweet tomatoes in a rich sauce.  The waitress probably came by the table to check-up at least a dozen times and was extremely cordial.  Again, \""$1.98 Taps 99 homebrews\"" is not a typo.  I think that it tastes great, especially with an orange in it.  \n\nOn Saturdays, they apparently have some live musicians as well.  I attached a picture of the musicians on the night that I was there.  For some white guys, they were pretty good at the whole reggae thing.  I closed my eyes and felt like I was almost back in the Caribbean for a moment.\n\nThey also have a happy hour from Monday through Friday where the homebrew is only 99 cents for each pint.

2786,2018-04-08 07:13:28,"So... My boyfriend and I found this place as one of the few (if not only) donut spots in Phoenix that's open 24/7. After he had a craving for donuts at 1AM, it had good reviews, and I saw on yelp that they served boba there, we decided to give it a go. When we got there, he first ordered a boba for me and began his dozen donuts order. The donuts he wanted (namely chocolate... Simple to make you would think) was not available at 1AM. He then asked for another type of donut (Boston cream)... Not available. Only ones they said they had at that time of night was glazed, raspberry filled, and lemon filled. He declined the donuts altogether because he was frustreated with continually getting \sorry, we don't have that\"".\n\nI gave this place a one star on his behalf and because I had my boba drink and it was descent, however, nowhere near the best I've tasted. I like my boba squishy and not too rough to chew. I tried boba at this one Viet restaraunt that was better but that's another yelp review in the making.\n\nOverall, case and point: we may have been better off going there earlier in the day and their selection seems to be EXTREMELY limited after typical business hours. If your business is said to be open 24 hours AND you're one of the only open available donut shops in the area that never close, PLEASE have a majority of your donut selection available around the clock.

It was a nice rainy day and we decided we wanted sit down pizza, a relaxed place so we decided to give Nellos another shot. So if you are the kind of person who wants a meaty specialty pizza...well, ouch! That's all I'll say about that. There 14\ specialty pizzas are quite hefty in price. We decided to go with a two topping 14\""...it was about $15 and we got the house salad (I think it was like $7 or $8). Their salad comes with cheese, tomatoes, black olives, mushrooms, and the cold cut of your choice. As I like the veggies but not meat or black olives and my boyfriend likes meat but not those veggies, we asked if we could get everything on the side. They were very nice and accommodated our request. We asked for ranch but it was a little more on the mayo side than I like so I asked for their house Italian instead. This Italian dressing was thick and a reddish color...I mixed a little in to do a taste test and found it very unique. This dressing is spicy! I mean, for a dressing, very spicy! I didn't really like it the first few bites but then found that I really enjoyed it; it was just so different from other Italian dressings it took a little getting used to. The pizza arrived and some of the toppings were under the cheese. It worried me a little since my half was vegetarian and my boyfriend's was super meaty! One half was tomato and basil and the other was sausage and pepperoni. This pizza has a tall but thin crust and is pretty thin. The two of us came pretty close to killing this whole thing...we only had a couple slices left. The crust was sweet and very different; the sauce was less like pizza sauce and more like a delicious pasta sauce. I really enjoyed it. The tomato was perfectly ripe and sliced thin; the basil was chopped thin and mixed into the sauce, it was sooooo good! From what I saw of the other half, the sausage looked home made, lumpy balls of spice that I'm sure I would enjoy if I ate meat...the pepperoni was under the cheese but I'm sure it was good too. Overall, good experience, a little more for pizza than we'd normally spend but for a yummy lunch date, perfect. We'll definitely be back...they have a lot of sauce-less vegetarian pizzas that I found intriguing and want to try ASAP. :-)""",DID5cPea,3964

Menu says you can get a drink and chips or pasta salad for an additional 2.50. That would bring the total price up to 11.50 for a sandwich,rtkQKL8h,3240

He already had a cocktail in hand so he was refilling what he was already having.  We then said, one for you and we'll have what you're having.  We proceeded to have 2 more rounds for all.  Then the bill came,  Razz never indicated that when we offered to \buy him a drink\"" he was having $160 per shot scotch.  As the owner, he should have made us aware of that drinks price.  We had over a $1300 bill before gratuity leaving that restaurant.  He already had his scotch in hand before we arrived, he was going to drink it anyway.  As the owner, he should have made us aware that each drink was $160.  I found the food good, not great but the service as the owner was inexcusable.  I felt totally taken advantage of and will never ever ever ever return because of his selfish proprietorship.

The most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in. 42\ HD TV. Beautiful view of the resort grounds.\n\nThe Resort Grounds:\nMeticulously taken care of. Grass is green. Pools and ponds are very well maintained. They have bocci ball and you can feed the Koi. (One caveat: wear a bathing suit when you feed the Koi. They are aggressive and will splash you in their excitement to get fed.)\n\nThe Staff:\nVery attentive, polite, and polished. \n\nAnd now for the bad.\n\nNO FREE WIFI. Seriously, name one hotel (or resort) that does not offer free wifi. Granted, you can go downstairs to their \""internet cafe\"" and as long as you are in the boundaries of that room, you can use their wireless internet (I do believe they shape the network. Certain applications run slowly.) You can pay for wifi: $12.95 for 24 hours (1 mb up/1 mb down). What a ripoff. Wireless internet should be standard.\n\nNo in-room coffee maker. Again, name a hotel (or resort for that matter) that does not have a coffee maker in the room. Le sigh.\n\nNo free breakfast. Not even a continental breakfast. You know, semi-ripe fruit, day old danishes, orange juice. Nope, not at the Phoenician.

2862,2018-04-12 07:56:48,"This week, our sushi quest brought us to Hiro Sushi in Scottsdale.  After last week's debacle, we wanted something that seemed like a more sure bet.\n\nWe started with the miso soup, and then ordered pretty much everything that seemed new and/or tasty.\n\nThe first dish that was served was our sashimi, which included uni (not the best I've had, but I'm spoiled after having had live sea urchin), toro (this was delicious), and Spanish mackerel (with deep fried bones!).  I am a mackerel fan, and the bones were even better.  I thought about asking if they had any extra Spanish mackerel bones lying around.\n\nNext, we had the ankimo, which was pretty good.  I've had better ankimo, but it was far superior to the ankimo we had at Hana Japanese Eatery over a month ago.\n\nAfter the ankimo, they brought the dynamite appetizer.  This was a baked scallop, mushroom, and cream dish that was pretty delicious, and a definite hit at our table (though it was inferior to the dynamite I had over a week earlier, which had geoduck in addition to scallops).\n\nWe then had the sushi: sea snail, edge of halibut, escolar, and jellyfish.  The halibut was garnished with too much wasabi for my taste, the sea snail was lightly flavored and crunchy, and the escolar was amazing.  (One of my friends pointed out this morning that escolar can cause diarrhea that is orange and oily, and I said, \So, basically like my diarrhea this morning.\""  I contend that it was worth it.)  The jellyfish was a first for me; it was crunchy with a bit of a spicy flavor (not sure if they seasoned it, or if this is naturally the way jellyfish tastes).\n\nAt this point, we decided that we wanted a little more, so we ordered grilled shishitou peppers and salmon roe.  The salmon roe was not the best I have had, but the peppers were pretty tasty (not as good as the ones they have at Roka Akor, however).\n\nOut of curiosity, I asked the waitress if they had any kama, which I did not see on the menu.  She said they had hamachi and salmon kama, which was only $8, so we sprung for the hamachi.  It was tasty and tender, but not as fall-off-the-bone tender or mouth-wateringly delicious as the hamachi kama we had at Sushi on Shea.\n\nFinally, we had the tempura ice cream, which was the best tempura ice cream I have found in Phoenix.\n\nOverall, Hiro seems like a very good sushi bar.  The food is fresh, they have some good special items, and it is actually very reasonably priced.  Unfortunately, it will be hard to go back here with Sushi on Shea being only a few miles down the road.""",xFYTejw1,2231

We got to listen in on the best conversations and we had the best view of all the amazing food going to the different rooms.  \n\nThe Food:  Sweet Tea served in a big Mason Jar.  SOLD!  It was awesome and the refills kept coming.  Soul Food without Sweet Tea is just wrong to me.  As for the rest of the Menu - it's not 30 pages long - in fact I'm pretty sure it's just one piece of paper written on both sides.  And yet it's still SO hard to choose.  The first time we went each of us got something slightly different.  Both my eating companions got some version of a meal that included both Chicken and Waffles.  I bucked the trend and got their Salmon Croquettes with Cheese Eggs, Grits and Waffles.  I could talk for days about how amazing their food is.  Best Eggs I'd ever had.  I am not a big egg person and I was craving these eggs again for a month.  The more I think about them the more I want to go.  The Salmon was amazing - I took one home and it was big enough I made myself a sandwich with it the next day.  The sides are all absolutely amazing.  The Greens have an amazing sweetness aftertaste that I am completely unable to describe.  The Chicken.  Oh, the Chicken.  Let's start w/ this.  I've always thought fried chicken was \""ok\"".  I went with 2 folks who love fried chicken - and make their own family handed down recipes.  After their first bites it looked like they had found the holy grail.  It was the best fried chicken I'd ever eaten.  Guess what I've saved for last?  The waffles.  I always eat waffles or pancakes last for 2 reasons 1) They are SO sweet just like a desert and 2) I can only eat a few bites worth.  They are usually too sweet, too sticky, and very quickly mushy.  So, I spread around the butter (removing most of it of course) and drizzled it with some syrup.  It was the lightest, yummiest, buttery heavenly thing I'd ever had.  These were not just waffles.  These were Waffles.  I ate almost the whole thing.  As for Lo-Lo's desert menu - I've heard great things about their Red Velvet cake - but I've never quite been able to get that far into my meal and still order more.  Maybe next time.\n\nService: We've always had great service.  Servers are usually young and have that \""I'm working at my uncle's restaurant for the summer\"" quality - but they are fast, knowledgeable and quick on the refills. \n\nAtmosphere: If you are from certain parts of the valley - Lo-Lo's may be a bit of a culture shock.  Yes, it is quite possible if you are of the Caucasian persuasion - you may be the only one there during your entire meal.  I've heard some folks say they would be \""afraid\"" to go because of that.  My thought?  Get the heck over it.  Should a black person be afraid to go to AZ 88 or Flemings because they might be the only black person there?  Heck no.  And wouldn't you think they were silly for even thinking it?  Exactly.\n\nOverall: Prices are good.  I honestly can't remember how much anything costs.  I blame the food.  But I do remember thinking \""wow, is that all?\"" every time we go.  Location is downtown - just minutes from AWA.  Food is out of this freaking world.  Calorie content is... well...  it's not something I like to think about.""",LHaxa5CD,3219

Then the server we had must have been on something she was so hyper and the things that came out of her mouth were ridiculous. Mind your own business and do not make small talk. PLEASE! Went through the line and didn't expect to see raw meat and fish in bins. That was not appetizing at all. I really don't want to see my meat before it is cooked. I chose scallops and if I go back I will to try a chicken dish. Veggies in bins were not fresh. Sauces were ok. Desserts were not appetizing. Bummed.,y1mPIMAc,3829

2878,2018-01-21 11:39:49,After 20 years of traveling around the world a five star review for an airline seems crazy to me but most recently I have been very impressed with Southwest.  The fairs are very reasonable almost certainly less in every case compared to the competition and with no hidden fees.  The free bags (your first 2) was also a huge part of the rating for this company.  On a recent flight with US Airways we paid more than $150.00 just for extra baggage fees to fly with them.  Goodbye US Airways you have lost our business forever.  Our last couple of flights to Vegas on Southwest we actually arrived ahead of schedule.  \n\nThe open seating on Southwest was a little different however once we got used to it this was actually a great concept as everyone simply chooses the seat they want.  If seating is of great importance to you just get their a little early and you will have first choice of the entire plane.  Awsome.  \n\nFinally,yOBPODGZ,4920

2881,2018-02-24 08:32:45,"A Co-worker of mine lamented last week \have you tried Humble Pie?, it's said to be the best pizza in Scottsdale.\"" I had a hard time believing this, better than Grimaldi's? Better than Nello's? Then I hoped on Yelp, saw some favorable reviews and decided, hey maybe it is!! So Husband and I ventured up north to the Tatum location on Saturday night. We instantly  noticed the open kitchen centered around the wood oven, the place was hoping. This must be good. After waiting for what seemed like several minutes the waitress finally arrived to take our drink order. Husband ordered and Shiner Hefe and I went with the featured Limoncello Margarita. Several minutes passed once again, and finally our drinks arrived and our order was taken. The first sip I took of my cocktail was like a punch in the gut. I am all for strong drinks, better value. This was strong to the point that it really was not enjoyable. Figuring it may take awhile we started with the antipasto board. I ordered the Egg pizza, Husband seemed delighted by the idea of the Coppa pizza. When the Antipasto arrived we were pleased, it was simple and amazing. Small bites of meats, cheeses, olives, marinated tomatoes accompanied by crusty bread. Now, slow, inattentive service, and bad cocktail aside, we were ready for the pizza. My pizza of whole mozzarella and prosciutto was topped with a sunny side up egg. It was good not great, the egg added a nice flavor that complemented the smokey prosciutto and crust. It did seem however it was really salty. I know prosciutto is a salty meat, but this tasted like the cheese and crust were carrying a good dose\n, just in case. I asked husband about his pizza, and he commented the same, very salty. We finished what we could of our salt licks and waited, and waited for our bill. I wanted to really like this place, but the slow service and salty pie left me feeling very meh, While the antipasto was good for my money I will take Grimaldi's, Nello's, La Grande Orange or Bianco any day.""",iz8es2qN,4038

2890,2018-03-02 01:55:09,My wife and I dined here last night.  It was dead.  We were there for about an hour and were the only people there.  A few people came and went for pickup orders but that is it.  It was like our own private dining room.  We were assured by the owner that during the winter months the place is almost always jam packed with snowbirds.\n\nFrom the looks and deadness of the place I was skeptical of the food/service but I was pleasantly surprised.  The food was awesome and so was the service.  The owner was friendly and an all around awesome lady.\n\nTo start we had baba ganoosh and hummus.  Both were very good and the pitas were ok but not house made.  Then we had a small house salad and lentil soup.  The lentil soup was excellent but the salad was just ok.

Service is quick and friendly enough, the place is clean, and the food comes out quick.

I've seen others get the breakfast burrito and the pancakes, all looked great and received great reviews.  Once, I got the Heart Scram (trying to be healthy) and it was alright, I just felt like it was missing something.  Cheese, maybe . . . cheese makes everything better, right?\n\nThe one time I went for lunch I ordered a Roma Tomato Chicken Melt (roma tomatoes, fresh basil, and garlic marinated in balsamic vinegar and olive oil, grilled chicken breast and melted provolone cheese on grilled parmesan sourdough bread).  To be honest, the description sounded way more interesting than the sandwich tasted.  Very plain.\n\nFor my side I got the chipotle sweet potato soup.

2893,2018-06-05 05:13:48,"My husband and I went to Mellow Mushroom for the first time last week because we had a Groupon for $10 off.  We were impressed with the service Evan, our waiter, gave us, as we had to be in and out in about 30 minutes and he made it happen despite the little league team that had come in just before us.\n\nThe food itself was, for the most part, great.  We shared a chopped salad with the house vinaigrette which was quite good, but I little expensive at $8.49.  Since we split it, though, the per person cost wasn't terrible.\n\nWhat really surprised us though was the price for the pizza.  Normally we like to order the equivalent of a Margherita Pizza (fresh mozzarella, fresh basil and tomatoes), but were dismayed not to see this on the menu and thus had to build our own.  To our astonishment both fresh basil and mozzarella were \double ingredients\"", which would have caused our total to be $21.74 before tax for a 14\"" medium traditional Margherita.  Wow.  We ended up opting just for the fresh basil, nixing the tomato and fresh mozzarella, to bring the pre-tax pizza total to $16.17--still expensive, but what the heck, we had a Groupon!\n\nThe most disappointing part was, when we got the pizza, the amount of fresh basil that was on it was barely close to covering, maybe an average of 6-8 small half-inch slivers per piece, even though we paid over $3 for it (which honestly would have bought us a full basil plant!).\n\nDespite that, the overall taste was great.  We really enjoyed the buttery/flaky crust and the sauce was just the right amount of sweet with a touch of tangy to it.\n\nOverall, we had a good experience.  The food, while a little overpriced, was quite enjoyable.  Mellow Mushroom really has the potential to be one of our local favorites, but until we see a little more value for the money we're paying for our ingredients, we may only be back the next time we see another Groupon deal pop up.""",E6T1b8jp,3674

Having a father who grew up on Los Olivos I remained a loyal customer, that is, until last evening's change in plans lured me to the colorfully lit and lively patio of Los Sombreros Authentic Mexican Cafe & Cantina.  I am not an expert on \authentic\"" Mexican cuisine nor will I pretend to know what  the flavors of San Miguel de Allende taste like; however, I am a foodie so I know good food when I eat it.  \n\nWe chose to sit outdoor and enjoy the beautiful weather while taking in another Cardinal's loss!  (Sad, I know, since they were off to a great start)....  Lucky for us it was a calm Monday night and we had the full attention of our waiter, aka the bartender.  Phil (no need to blush if you read this) did a wonderful job walking us through their many margarita selections while also conveying his personal favorites that showcased his love for whiskey!  My friend allowed Phil to make his margarita as he felt a fine margarita should be made while I allowed Phil to concoct my special margarita while following strict no sugar, no salt, heavy on the tequila preferences...and that was just to start!  Perfectly crafted margaritas in hand, check.  Now what to eat for dinner.  \n\nMy friend ordered his beloved Mole poblano ($18.95) while I couldn't decide between the Smoked chicken enchiladas with salsa verde and chipotle crema (yumm) and the Pollo a la parilla with spinach in a chipotle cream sauce -or- tinga Poblana sauce($18.95).  I opted for the Pollo a la parilla with chipotle cream preparation and, once again, my dinner friend had 'order envy'!!  That's not to say his Mole was par (or dare I say sub-par) because it wasn't - it actually has received many culinary awards being named \""Best Mole\"" both locally and nationally, but because the chipotle cream sauce combined with spinach, perfectly saut\u00e9ed  chicken breasts and a side of warm corn tortilla is....AMAZZZZZZING!!!!  It's also fair that I note aside from the pricier entree dishes served w two sides (as we ordered), they also offer up tacos (3 at $10.95), various quesadillas (@ $5.95) and other lesser priced authentic eats including fresh guacamole, salads and more!  \n\nDeciding I'd save room to see if they could satisfy my sweet tooth I boxed my remaining dinner as we read through each and every dessert.  Undecided, again, and so we trusted our gastronomy guide, Phil, to choose.  He selected the Mexican Chocolate Cream Pie to finish off the evening, and we happily finished off this delectable treat leaving one bite as I always like to do!!!   \n\nThank you, Phil and Los Sombreros, for the memorable dining experience.  The food was outstanding, margaritas made by Phil are the best, and the patio alone is enough to draw me back for HH or even a late night dessert.  Thank you for staying in the neighborhood, Azucena Tovar, and congrats on almost turning 20 years old.""",NMpvFFqh,602

The waitress was ditzy and favored the \elbow in the face\"" serving technique. Although our drinks stayed full, my friend somehow had the luxury of receiving 3 full glasses of coke, despite his first glass not even being close to empty and ended up being waste. Our orders arrived inconsistently and staggered, with meals being brought out seemingly one at a time. This left some of us at the table waiting minutes until everyone had their food. \n\nThe sounding of the FIRE ALARM marked the highlight of the visit. A friend had ordered the cookie dessert (basically a warm cookie topped with ice cream). Not only did she receive the cookie still well into the process of finishing her breakfast, but the waitress had explained that the fire alarm was no concern. She explained the alarm was triggered by leaving the now black and charcoal-smelling cookie placed on our table in the oven too long causing a large amount of  smoke (....hwhat..??!). It was easily the most awful looking, foul smelling dessert I had ever seen brought out of any commercial kitchen. Why the waitress even thought anyone would consider eating a hockey puck is beyond me. Oh, and the cookie was topped with an abundance of ice cream and chocolate sauce so as to conceal the burnt look and smell I'm guessing. SMOOTH MOVE. Obviously after one terrifying bite it was immediately sent back. Needless to say, they were suddenly out of cookies for the day, but that's understandable since its the number one ordered item at 10 am right? Right? The waitress deleted the cookie off the check but nothing else. No alternative dessert, no discount, not even a free OJ. The manager was non existent. \n\nCheap food? Yes. Open late? Yes.

I had lunch there once in the mid 1990's, and went in to watch a Suns playoff game a few years back when my friend was decked out in Spurs gear and we were nearly lynched at Half Moon.  Quick lunch with a girlfriend who was in the mood for a burger about a year ago.  \n\nWhile I love, and I do mean LOVE a good dive bar, this place scared the crap out of me.  I'm young, not hideous, female, and not of the meth-head variety - so not only did I not blend, but I felt targeted.  Sad, really.  The ONE bar within easy drunk stumbling distance from my house, and I wasn't happy going there.  During a weekday for lunch was more or less okay.  But evenings are when the freaks come out.  And I don't mean the freaks like me.  I mean the dangerous crazy ones - not just the fun crazy ones.  There's a difference!\n\nWell, enter the new roommate.  He was disinclined to believe my review, and insisted we go.  I resisted until late Saturday night, when he came home at 1am and insisted I get dressed so we could go there for an hour.  Maybe I was tired.  Maybe I needed a change of pace.  Whatever the reason, I gave in, got dressed and we walked over to Harvey's.\n\nYAY!  According to Echo, the bartender (yes, it's her real name.  her parents are hippies like mine), the owner has been working hard to improve the place (read: clientele) for over a year.  It shows!  \n\nEcho is three shades of awesome - the perfect gal to be running the bar!  Easy smile, quick wit, great sense of humor and the talent to mix a great drink while cooking any of the grub from the menu.  She is a one woman show and pulls it off like a champ!\n\nJune drink specials included $2.00 Beam 5 Star bourbon, Yukon Jack, and I don't remember what else.  I asked for a bourbon and coke, the roommate asked for his bourbon neat.  (Brave - cheap bourbon *needs* to be cut with something!).  The pour is solid and consistent  Oh, and did I mention you can get a mixed drink, anytime day or night for just two bucks?  For $2!!\nTwo drinks for me, two shots for him, a beer chaser for him and a cheese wineburger split between us.  Under $14!!  Holy hell, it's cheaper to drink here than it is at home!\n\nAnd at home - we don't have the entertainment of the other patrons.  Like Cowboy who would do the splits on demand.  And suggest my roommate go through the needed steps for a game of \rodeo\"" with his girlfriend. You just can't make this up!\nOh - and he bestowed slightly drunk me with a new nickname.\nApparently, I am a \""prick ass bitch.\""  I don't know how he meant it, but I am taking it as a compliment and will wear it with pride!\n\nOh, yes.  I will certainly be back!  A LOT.""",stphT8bv,2464

He thinks it shows character to not compromise your own beliefs to make money. I think it shows common sense to allow me to exchange my money for your chicken any time I damn well please. So we agree to disagree.\n\nChick Fil A is definitely up there with Chipotle and In & Out as a top tier \Fast Food\"" place. Their chicken is juicy and tender and delicious and they come with tons of pickles, which I love. My similarities to Snookie end there. They also give you a bunch of different sauce options, so when you get a really good sandwich, you feel like you can kind of take some of the credit because you chose the sauce. I am all about heaping undeserved praise on myself, so this really helps with that. Okay, my similarities to Snookie end THERE.\n\nTheir fountain drink machine has both Coke Zero AND Diet Dr Pepper as zero calorie options, which is fantastic. I wish all places would start offering more diet options in their fountain machine. I mean, seriously, who drinks real soda? Besides, maybe, during a hangover? I just cannot fathom consuming 240 empty calories just so my Coke has real corn syrup in it. Actually, all places just need to just get those touch screen coke machines, including this Chick Fil A, if they haven't (which I'm not sure because I've only used the drive through).\n\nFinally, the employees are all SUPER nice. At first I thought it was a fluke, and I just happened to get a ridiculously pleasant drive through attendant, but they've all been like that so it must be part of their training or something.

Based on the pictures and other reviews, I was anticipating \cowboy\"" style but in reality the leather booths, sleek bar area and cool, modern open kitchen were anything but rustic. Although not as classy as Cowboy Chao, this place is definitely way more upscale than the nearby Pink Pony or Saddle Ranch. I got sort of a mellow supper-club vibe from the classic cocktails on the menu and the jazz music playing in the background. There were very few people in the dining area when we ate there on Sunday evening since it was early (we arrived shortly after they opened at 4:30) but I can see how this place probably gets much more upbeat on Friday and Saturday nights. \n\nThe menu at Bandera is not really my style of food but my hubby really liked the roasted chicken and beef rib combo that he ordered. Of course, like everyone else we had to start with the cornbread and it really lived up to the hype. It was truly amazing. I ordered the Macho salad which was ok; I would have enjoyed it a lot more if it did not have WAY TOO MUCH dressing. All the flavors were good but that kind of ruined it for me. Fortunately I had ordered the artichoke appetizer as a side dish and so I was happy to munch on that instead. We were too stuffed for dessert but I did spy a couple on the menu that sounded great. I think I would love to come here another night for drinks and dessert but there are so many other good restaurants in the area that I haven't tried yet I doubt we will be back to Bandera for dinner. I wish I could give it 3 1/2 stars since it did exceed my expectations and it is a better than average restaurant but I just didn't like it as much as my 4 star places.""",QWaKKXxG,2864

I took my roommate with me, so I didn't look like a goober sitting in a booth by myself. We walked in as the Hostess was finishing a reservation over the phone, and we were greeted when she finished. She gave us the option of booth, or table.  I went with booth (I didn't want to sit at a table in the middle of an empty room). The hostess took us to our booth, set our menus down, said the server would be here in a minute, and took off.  Not to friendly, but she did her part. \nAs we looked over our menu a staff member brought us some bread, and water. Seconds after, our server came to our table and introduced herself, asking if we wanted anything else to drink besides water. Both my roommate and I ordered a Peroni, which is an Italian beer.  I also asked for an order of calamari which she stated was \very good.\"" The server brought us our drinks followed by the calamari. She came back a minute later and asked if we were ready to order, or if we needed more time to look over the menu. Both my roommate and I were ready; so we placed our order for the main course. I ordered the baked penne, and my roommate ordered the chicken Marsala. During our order the server gave us the option of soup or salad. I got the soup, which was minestrone, and my roommate went with the salad. \nOur server filled our waters without us having to ask, and kept us informed on the progress of our main course. Once the calamari was finished she cleared our plates and went to get our main course. \nShe brought our main course out one at a time (probably because the help she needed was napping in another booth off in the corner, where I saw him). Once she placed our food down she asked if we needed anything else: We said no, and she took off after saying \""enjoy your food guys.\"" \nThe calamari was covered in breading and had good flavor, despite its being mushy in texture (It came with ranch, marinara, and cocktail sauce). My minestrone soup was bland and lukewarm, the salad my roommate had was in his words, \""pretty good.\"" My baked penne looked really good, but fell just shy of making par. The penne was cooked perfectly and there was plenty of ground Italian sausage (which was very good). However, the sauce was a bit watery, and the cheese that was on top was a bit rubbery. I asked my roommate how his chicken marsala was, and he said it was great. I can't say much more than that since I didn't eat it. \nAfter we had finished as much as we were going to eat; the server cleared our plates and asked if we would like any dessert. Since my roommate and I were full, we said no to the offer of dessert after she listed a few of the options to spark our interest. The options sounded good, but we were just too full from our meal.\nOur server thanked us for coming in when she brought our check back to the table after we paid. As we left, the Hostess station was empty but we still got a, \""goodnight and thanks for coming in\"" from somebody, who I did not see anywhere.

2982,2018-02-28 06:26:16,I am upping my score by one star just because I do happen to love their food more right now. Their pizza is phenomenal along with a few other things.  I shall try their burgers tonight because its been long enough to where I cant remember how good they might be. I know their turkey burger is amazing but its time for a change tonight.\nI tried the honey hot wings last time and wasn't impressed unfortunately.\n\nThe other night I was feeling totally adventurous and risky! Sooo I tried the burger with the smoked gouda and bbq onions. Which had me confused because for once I cannot recall ever trying BBQ onions in my lifetime.  When they came after maybe 10 minutes later I didn't love the pairing of the gouda and bbq onions and ground bacon together. Now believe me ive had a 50/50 burger with ground beef and ground bacon. San tan does not compare to the original 50/50 in California in any size shape or fashion. It irritates me almost to even think back on how salty the burger was and the pairings with it did not work! AT ALL. i scraped off the onions and ate them with my fries which by the way was superb!\n\nSo even though i gave them one extra star its mostly because their food has been hit or miss lately and i really love it when its on point and amazing.,q3ePS1hI,523

Ordered the #2.....2 eggs, 2 pancakes, 2 sausage patties and 2 strips of bacon for $5.99.  Everything was fine except the sausage which had a peculiar flavor....the bacon strips were thick and tasty, the eggs okay, and the cakes were very good with an interesting touch....instead of the normal one glob of butter on top of the two cakes, there was one on top and one between the two cakes (made for easy buttering of the bottom cake).  All in all worth another try (might have been just an off day for the sausage).  Wish it were closer to home!""",mxNeO3wu,4590

One paragraph is simply not enough room for me to describe a restaurant.\n\nWith that said.. I totally forgot that on my Southwest tour I also visited a buffet while I'm in Phoenix...(Peter C. really enjoys my buffet reviews so I'm gonna make sure that I review each and every buffet I go to! Just for you Peter!!!)\n\nSo it's about 8:15pm and we just arrived into Phoenix from Sedona after a 12 hr road trip...  I wanted something to eat but knowing that simple burger was not gonna do it.  So to treat my buddy I've decided to find a high reviewed buffets to indulge on!  (Thanks yelpers!)\n\nThe place closes at 9:00pm so we had to work quick...

Because that's how good the food here is.\n\nOne of the best things about life in Phoenix is that if you do have to resort to \fast food,\"" you're not limited to the enormous over-advertised chains.  Taqueria Los Angeles is quick and inexpensive, so technically it probably is fast food, but the quality is so much better than anything you'll find at a traditional fast food burger place.\n\nThe salsas are fresh and flavorful.  The tacos come in different varieties of beef, pork, chicken, or fish.  (Looking for ground beef?  Go to Taco Bell.)  The burritos are enormous.  And it's all made to order.\n\nThere are a few clean tables inside and a TV tuned to a Spanish channel, but not much else in the way of d\u00e9cor.

You order at the counter, and they bring your your meals.  You fill your own drinks.\n\nAll the \Stir Fry Your Way\""s are delicious.  I haven't made it to their curries yet, but I'm expecting greatness here too.  But one real standout is their Orange Shrimp.   It might not be the healthiest thing on the menu, and of course it tends to the sweet side, but it's hand-battered, and let me tell you, the breading is out of this world.  I don't know what they do to make it so rich and light at the same time, but the magic works.\n\nThis is not a large place and I sometimes wonder if I'm going to have a place to sit, but it's never failed me or my family yet.  The proprietor seems to always be there and I think his son runs the counter much of the time.  They're both wonderful hosts and they seem to have set a tone of friendliness and helpfulness with the rest of the staff.   It's a really nice, but no-frills atmosphere with really excellent food.

Well, with mediocre expectations actually, I was not impressed with their BURGER.\n\nI was really, really hoping that it would be better than this! Really! :)\n\nI ordered their \Little\"" cheese burger, which is a single patty burger.  I added my favorite toppings, mushrooms and onions, no extra cost (btw).  For sides, I ordered their Regular Cajun Fries that came in like a 16 oz. cup.  Excellent, seasoned very well and soft and tasted very, very POTATO-ee.  I would go back just for that.\n\nThe two problems to me were the BUNs and the PATTY.  If I didn't know any better, the buns were made of saw dust or card board! During the process of them compiling the burger, I did not see them toasting or buttering the buns like most places would.\n\nThe patty was not juicy or had that beefy flavor, I tasted mostly the DRY buns.

I've been searching for years.\n\nNestled in the deep corner of a dimly light strip mall and beneath a huge old clock, Classic Italian Pizza is full of patrons who are raving about the delicious wood fire cooked pizza, salads and the best tiramisu this side of the Mississippi.  We're overjoyed that we've discovered this place.\n\nThis is an expensive classy pizza joint, serving Italian-style thin crust pizzas with all the freshest and highest quality toppings.  The pizzas come in one size, 12\.  Your meal comes with fresh wood fired italian bread.  I highly recommend dipping the bread into their house dressing, absolutely amazing!  Speaking of which, the fresh salad and their house dressing were among the best we'd ever had.\n\nIt's hard to find a good Sangria and since everything was tasting so good, we decided to give it a shot.  Strong, but perfectly tasty.  This is a very good drink.\n\nWe ordered the Italian Sausage, which comes with chopped mushrooms, green peppers and onions.  Naturally, I had to add pepperoni to this pie.  OUT-OF-THIS-WORLD EXCELLENT!  Wow, I'm coming back many many times and screaming from rooftops about how good this pizza is.  I'm from Chicago and hate just about everything in Arizona, so you can see my excitement in finding this place.\n\nWe've also since come back and tried the four seasons pizza, which is basically split into four different sections; each with proscuitto, parmesan, and tomato sauce: tomato, olive, artichokes, mushrooms.  The tomato was so damn good we will definitely be ordering this again.\n\nThe service is great, obviously a family run operation.  The same three people were working there each time I've come.

At 7:45 (30 minutes later) my husband checked in the hostess and she said they were work off a list and they would get to us when the got to us. A few minutes later they sat two separate couples that had just arrived. I checked in with the hostess and asked why they were seated and we are still waiting. She played dumb and said, \What couple? What were their names?\"" At that time the person seating came back and the hostess asked if she just sat a couple and she said yes. The seater assured us they were clearing our table at that moment. Fifteen minutes later and another couple being seated I was very upset. I confronted the hostess. Her response was, \""Give me a minute Ma'ma\"" she then ran off. The seater came back with the hostess and said she would seat us now. \n\nOur waiter was nice, but clearly overwhelmed. A good portion of the food; however, was subpar. My husband got the \""Famous What Is In This Steak\"" and the steak that was enrobed in mashed potatoes was a subpar piece of meat that had no flavor.

The only food item we enjoyed was the asparagus risotto. \n\nWe did not get out of the restaurant until 9:30, thus not being able to keep our plans we had made for after dinner. \n\nNow here is the kicker. A co-worker of mine had made a reservation for 6 to Eddie's House and did not keep the reservation. Eddie called her 6-7 times that night and the next day. When she answered his call he asked her if she was okay and he was so worried about her.

3023,2018-03-17 10:50:39,"Deemos American Grill is a tiny little bar tucked far, far away in the rear (heehee) of the Camelback Esplanade.  In fact, its location is so obscure, I honestly don't know how people stumble upon it.  Deemos is neither interesting nor original; if you do happen to find it, I can't imagine that you would go back.\n\nI, however, did go back.  Let me explain...\n\nFirst, I would like to say that I have been a Deemos patron a handful of times and only on Wednesday nights.  Why Wednesday nights, you might ask?  Well, Wednesday night is karaoke night!\n\nIt all started when a friend of mine called and asked me to go to karaoke with her and of course, I obliged.  I love to tear up a mic every now and then.  I had trouble finding the place (surprise!) and I wasn't terribly impressed when I got there.\n\nThere is a smoking patio outside, so if you're a smoker, that totally rocks.  If you're not a smoker, you may get turned off dodging smoke rings as you walk through the patio to get in the front door.  Inside, there is a U-shaped bar, some high tables, low tables and a couple of booths.  \n\nI'm pretty sure they have a menu, but I've never eaten there and I've never actually seen anyone eating there.  The drink prices aren't great but they aren't really expensive.  I know this because I am a patient person.  The bartenders are awful.  Wait.  Let me tell you what they're good at doing.  They are really good at ignoring you for an exorbitant amount of time, going outside for a 20 minute smoke break, mixing the wrong drink and treating you like they don't really work for tips.\n\nThe ONLY reason I went in the first place and the ONLY reason I went back was the karaoke.  And that's also the reason I gave a 2-star review instead of a 1-star review!\n\nNickstar Entertainment (www.nickstarkaraoke.com) runs the show at Deemos on Wednesday nights from 9pm til 1am.  They are awesome.  They have the biggest selection of songs I've ever seen in my life AND their books are organized.  Their collection is digital.  Their mics are good.  They are fun and genuinely good people.  \n\n\Dear Nickstar, I am your biggest cheerleader.  You are the only reason Deemos is still in business.  They should thank you... and pay you extra.\""\n\nBut now I have a problem.  I won't be going to Deemos anymore.  Unfortunately, Nickstar is having a censorship problem due to poor management (surprise) and a group of people who have apparently complained about being offended by some of the performances, namely those that incorporate the use of curse words.  \n\nHmmm...  Bar + Drunk People = F-Bombs.  Isn't that a standard people have come to expect?  I can't imagine someone being offended by a couple of curse words IN A BAR.  But apparently, it's become a problem for some and a disappointment to others who enjoy flexing their 1st amendment rights (and their wicked ability to rock a mic).\n\nHonestly, I can't believe that Deemos would sell out like that.  Wait, actually it really doesn't surprise me that much.  The only thing I'm disappointed about is missing out on some great karaoke, but I can catch Nickstar in Tempe (and I will!).\n\nDeemos American Grill, I will never visit your establishment again and I won't miss it.  Shame on you.""",4ELHItDp,4596

3028,2018-01-22 18:13:02,"This is a chain, but not all chains have to be bad news. They're Arizona-based, so if you live here, why not patronize their business? The money is still staying in your state. Most chains are bad news and grace the armpits of major cities like rampant pubic lice (also known as \strip mall Hells\""), but these guys might restore your faith in that all-too-often abused model, a little.\n\nSomehow, though, they still reminded me a bit of a tiny Souplantation where the food is brought to you and the menu is innovative. It's probably just the pale wood interior and glass sneeze guards. But these people are reviving the ancient art of breadmaking and turning it into something trendy and accessible to people who don't eat at anything but chains. ( I saw a picture of someone making bread in a book in an antique shop once.) They need at least some kudos for this. \n\nOn to my meal: the Caribbean Jerk chicken salad is pretty darned good. I didn't find it spicy enough, and I would have put fresh thyme, some shallots, scotch bonnet peppers, and the tiniest breath of allspice in it, but I did field research in the Caribbean and know how that stuff is supposed to taste. This was the first Caribbean jerk anything that I've ordered on any menu and didn't find deeply disappointing. The size of the salad was perfect--not too big (salads don't keep well as leftovers), and not too small (it was sufficiently filling and I'm 6'3\""). The pieces of nondescript bread on the side were homemade, so how could I complain?\n\nMy wife's roast beef with gorgonzola cheese was gone before I could demand my own bite. Her little sister's roasted sweet potato sandwich (carb-on-carb seemed redundant, but what else can vegetarians really eat?) was also much appreciated by the little sis, and was gone before I could bully the slightest smidgen out of her. There wasn't much service, but it was fast; the atmosphere was industrial, but I saw a lot of cool combinations of ingredients. \n\nI would have liked to have seen less of a \""we're trying to make mega bank and stick only to things we know we do well\"" atmosphere, but a chain is a chain to some degree. There are also very few items for people with gluten allergies or who can't eat bread. But for lunch on a Sunday afternoon in strip mall Hell, this place was more than adequate, earning it an \""A-OK\"" rating of three stars.

For the first time, I thought I'd try \The Original.\""  This burger is some greasy goodness.   The burger is so juicy and tender and I inhaled it so quickly.  The fresh vegetables make this burger a classic.  I think one of the reasons it tasted so well was all the grease.  Fat and grease may be bad for you, but it just tastes so great.   \n \nThere's a huge selection of shakes for whatever you're in the mood for.  When you get the chance, try them all!  I tried the original strawberry shake.  When it arrived, it came in a cool mug, and another cup of the extra.  It's big enough to share.  The real whipped cream was thick.  The ice cream was so rich, smooth, and thick.  The shake went down my throat so smoothly and there were no icicle chunks.  The only chunks is the small pieces of strawberry.

I wasn't prepared for the Tango that night.\n\nMonday morning (Christmas Eve), I get up and out of the house early, as I have a full day of plans in order to prepare for my family's 'stuff', so I hit Inza early. Closed. \Closed All Day - Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.\"" I should have expected this as they are family owned. and operated. Damn, I was looking forward to it.\n\nSo today, I drive into the familiar-by-now-parking-lot and enter the little coffee space to have a cup of coffee before my day's workout. Its early and the place is almost full. There's a business meeting going on in the corner and all the little comfy chairs and tables are almost full. What's really nice is that strangers are obviously interacting with strangers and you can tell there's some kick-ass conversations going on. There is nothing superficial or pretentious about this space or the people who are hanging out here. \n\nThe woman who takes the order for my coffee has a blinding and authentic smile. She's never seen me before and yet I feel like she's really happy I am in this little space. If she's not the owner or part of the family, I suggest that the ownership give this woman a raise - because she's running the business like she owns it. She cared about my coffee and that's a hard trait to find anywhere, anymore. \n\nI sip my coffee and am pleased. Not overjoyed. Not pushed over the edge. Its good coffee. It's well balanced, nutty and has a nice acidity. It's not burnt or bitter, yet its not as dark or robust as I usually drink my coffee either. Its good but the vibe in this little coffee space and how I feel when I leave here is even better. My persistence in stopping by paid off.""",8JrX2a7q,4431

It's a beautiful area that allows  you to really appreciate the desert and is full of really awesome views of the city, the immediate desert surroundings, and the distant mountains.\n\nFor more information regarding the preserve, you may want to visit http://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/preserve.asp or http://www.mcdowellsonoran.org . At these websites, you can download copies of maps for the preserve.\n\nFor a quick but challenging hike, I recommend the Sunrise Trail. You can reach the Sunrise Trailhead by driving east on Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd and turning left on Via Linda. Keep driving through Via Linda until you hit a gated community. At the gate, hang left into a small dirt parking lot. This lot is typically full on the weekend mornings, but there is another dirt parking lot just before it primarily intended for horse trailers. The elevation difference is 1095' and is rated \difficult\"" by the preserve which is one rating below \""very difficult\"". The length of the trail from trailhead to Sunrise Peak is about 2 miles. Once at the top, you get a great view of the Matazal Mountains in the northeast as well as the valley. It's definitely worth making it to the top.\n\nThat's just one of the trails I frequent and a route I like to take when I need to get some outside time, but don't have much time to do it. I usually take this route towards late afternoon and finish up at sundown. There's really so much at the preserve and I could probably go on and on about having logged in so many hours appreciating what is there. It's best to discover it for yourself. Checking the websites I previously mentioned is a great starting point as they are very detailed about what is offered. \n\nI highly recommend the McDowell Sonoran Preserve. I thoroughly enjoy my experiences there and believe it was a well thought out project.""",uEjq48P5,3621

3125,2018-03-18 03:48:40,"I never wrote a mean review before but unfortunately, I had to for this particular Olive Garden. My family owns a restaurant and I am exceptionally sympathetic to servers and kitchen staff, but I couldn't even offer that with this restaurant.\n\nI took one of my best friends out to lunch yesterday and had an awful experience while we were there. It took a few minutes for our waitress to come to our table, but that is never a big deal to me. When she came to take our drink orders, we asked for lemon water and a cherry coke. That is a total of two drinks - why did it take longer than 15 minutes to receive?\n\nThen, our food. We ordered an appetizer (stuffed mushrooms) and as common sense goes, appetizers should be the first order to the kitchen so you can munch while waiting for your main entrees. That didn't happen. Our appetizer took over 30 minutes to arrive and for most people, I get irritated when I'm hungry. Still, I was incredibly polite to her because I know what it feels like to be a waitress (even if it's my family's place). I think our server is one of those people who might not care to satisfy friendly customers - they take advantage of kindness and give priority to customers who are screaming and yelling instead. \n\nTo not continue this long rant, our entrees didn't show up for another thirty minutes. I asked about the wait two times and she said, verbatim, \yeah I don't really know what's taking so long. I forgot to put the order in but it still shouldn't take this long for lasagna.\"" \n\nThat was unprofessional and I asked to speak to a manager at that point, but, surprise surprise! The manager never showed up and we had to wait an additional 15 minutes before we decided to forget about it and leave. \n\nI didn't forget, though. It was supposed to be a nice lunch with a friend and because I didn't get to speak to a manager, I had to put a review on Yelp.""",ZMfVBHdy,4077

Almost everyone who works here is sweet as daisies and they even occassionally let me out with my black coffee for free. \n\nThe location is generally quiet and well behaved as far as patrons go so I don't even mind hanging out for a bit to work on my crosswords.\n\nThis location does a great job of reminding me that Starbucks was once a neighborhood coffee house with good business values.,czCstxag,3482

3128,2018-05-19 00:39:14,"One word that describes Thai Spices is \meh\"".  \n\nLocated in MeKong Plaza, it took over the old BoCa 7 space.  When walking in the place, you'll notice its nice decor.  alas, it was left behind by the previous tenant (yes that is real gold wall paper fyi).  The place was quiet for a Friday night and we came there for my bday.  Apparently happy hour is extended till 7:30pm but its not stated or noted anywhere.  Since we had a big party, we ordered a multiple of their appetizers.  The most notable ones are surprisingly not thai related.  The crab puffs were very unique and good as well as the calamari rings.  Who would of thought the secret sause (thousand island) would make a diffrence.  After that, everything pretty much went down hill from there.  The thai dishes were not very good.  We had the pad thai, a little on the sweet side, plus the portions are a little small.  Also the green curry was salty, i have a very salty palate, but even this was more than my liking.  But it was good though, good with rice that is.  Also even though we got it \""mild\"" it still had a healthy kick of spices.  The Thai fried rice was also mediocre and a lil on the oily side.  The Tom Yum soup was good.  Again nothing special but atleast it didnt taste off.  Again this was a lil on the salty side too.  The only notable dish that we had was the Papaiya salad with salted crab.  That has a unique after taste.  \n\nSo in review, if you were at MeKong Plaza and had a craving for Thai food, then lucky you.  But its not a place you'd actually actively seek out if you werent literally already there.  \n\nPros:\n-happy hour specials daily 4 to 7:30Pm (supposedly)\n-great happy hour specials that are actually delish!\n- great decor hahahha\n\nCons:\n- food is sub par\n- thai specialties are sub par\n- thai tea wasnt a home run.\n- prices are not reflective of the quality and quantity.""",kXyuQOV1,2698

We waited at the bar for the rest of our party to arrive, and I was happy with the drink options.\n\nOnce our party had all arrived we moved to a table...\n\nHere's where things get lame:\n\nFirst, one of my good friends asks our server about some wine and he just shrugs and says he doesn't drink wine, but that they have a \wine guy\"", aka a sommelier which he couldn't pronounce, but that he was at they're other restaurant....\nNext, when I order I ask which seafood dish is best and he told me the Happy Family. It's a mix of shrimp, calamari, chicken, and scallops with veggies in a brown sauce, which sounded pretty good to me. Looking back I think he only suggested it because it was one of the more pricier options, at $15.95. \nI love veggies and it was mostly snap peas with some broccoli mixed in, so I grab a snap pea and immediately want to spit it out. It tasted like soap :( plus the sauce wasn't brown at all, it was kinda clear. Not much flavor at all, except for the soapy flavor :(\nI didn't eat much but took the rest home for left overs. Later that night and for the rest of the weekend, I had some weird stomach issues but nothing too serious and chalked it up to the drinking from the same night. \nOn Monday night, I heated up my left-overs and only took 2 or 3 bites because it tasted so horrible and immediately made my stomach hurt. The next morning I woke up to the worst case of food poisoning I've ever had. I won't give you all the gross details, but I was so sick I couldn't even stand to take a shower. \n\nI read another review just now with someone else getting sick from seafood, so DO NOT order seafood from this place!!""",fSfAgpO4,408

So that little irritation aside, we were seated and greeted again by a very nice bartender/server. I mentioned that I was STARVING and ordered the pita burrito, the bartender asked me if I've ever had the Medchilada. I said no, she said \""Oh you must try it, it's full of beans and you can add chicken.\"" PERFECT. After a very short wait, our orders arrived. My friend had the Philly Chicken Pita and the other had the broiled chicken pita. EVERYONE was in pita heaven! My food was so flavorful!

I don't usually eat brown rice because it tends to be crunchy or too grainy, Pita Jungle has managed to make brown rice moist and enjoyable! very nice!

A readily revolving reservoir of refreshing remedies, Taste of Tops is a veritable oasis for a beer connoisseur, amateur snob, or DGAF type alike (although it DEFINITELY caters to the former two). I've struck up many a random conversation with individuals with far more knowledge than myself and it has not only expanded my interest in several types or styles of beer I would have not tried, it has also humbled me to the extent of how much one can really know about beer in general. If you're intimidated, it's OK. Step back... take a breath... pick something... and dive in.\n\nTo be honest, I felt somewhat out of place the first time I sallied up to the bar. It can seem intimidating for someone who's not been in a \speakeasy\"" style establishment, as seating can sometimes be difficult to come by and it sometimes seems like everyone knows everyone else BUT you. It's worth the wait and the temporary sense of possible discomfort. Trust me.\n\nThe biggest benefit (for me, at least) is the sheer amount of beers you can \""technically\"" consume whilst at the establishment. For those who aren't satisfied by their constantly refreshing draft menu, you are able to inform your bartender what specific beer from any fridge they have available you'd like to consume (Taste of Tops or Tops Liquors) and after paying a monetary bottling fee, enjoy it amid friends (or enemies, if that's you're bag). Nonetheless, I appreciate the extreme variety of choice that Taste of Tops offers.\n\nThey constantly have wine or beer tastings, freshly tapped kegs of relatively unknown or difficult to find stuff (HOPSLAM!!!) and a friendly staff of people who honestly appreciate, are interested in, and want to promote the craft beer community.

A must try in Chandler.  Feel sorry for the \""other\"" place next door.  No competition....Try Rudy's...you won't be sorry!""",cLwDwXmn,1974

3193,2018-05-08 05:43:15,"The combination of chicken and waffles has baffled me for years. I never quite understood what would inspire a chef to serve these two unlikely meals on the same plate, but couldn't ignore how much folks raved about it. Day 25 of my 30 day blogging challenge  called for a \first\"" of sorts and I figured I'd get out of the house and do something new. Despite seeming like a breakfast/dinner clusterfuck, I opened my mind as well as my stomach, and ventured to Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles.\n\nIt had been years since I went to the original Phoenix restaurant (the epitome of a hole in the wall) but I did remember the food being good. Since the company branched out to include a Scottsdale location I was thrilled to only travel 5 mins for food. The location is nice, though I agree it doesn't have quite the \""charm\"" of the original location. It felt more like a little, sit down restaurant than a hot food spot.\n\nI fought the urge to stick with what I know and get catfish... but ended up biting the bullet and ordering the #10 (Tre-Tre - $7) which consisted of 2 legs and 1 waffle, a side of fried okra ($3.50) and \""red\"" kool-aid.The restaurant happened to be running low on legs so there was a bit of a wait but I came equipped with a magazine so it wasn't a big deal.\n\nThe Verdict? It wasn't a bad meal but I don't think I'd ever order this again. It didn't taste bad... not at all, but I guess it just felt like I was paying for something my mom could've made me lol. The only reason to pay for this meal is because you don't have access to cooking it yourself. The Okra was just okay. I like Church's okra better. My mom has made better chicken but I'd take their waffles. This meal reminded me of going to Sprinkles for cupcakes. It's more about the hype around the place  than the actual meal itself... or it could be because my mom is from the heart of Mississippi and knows how to put her foot in southern food. Ehh.. I'm glad to say that I tried something new so I can turn it down in the future based on personal experience and not a notion.\n\nSidenote: The credit card machine was glitching out when I was there so next time I'd just bring cash. The staff was VERY friendly and it was a pleasant experience... just felt like I paid for a meal I could've gotten from home.""",X23kVrTf,3471

We were stuck far away from the pond next to a dirty server station and rusty spigot and hose.  When we asked to move \nothing else was available\"" . . . \n\nFor an appetizer I ordered the Queso Guillermo.  The only thing accurate about the menu description was \""hot bubbling . . .\""  The add-on crispy beef Machomos was truly bad - the two bites I had you had to soften it in your mouth for 30 seconds before you could chew it - like really old beef jerky.  The cheese was stuck to the bottom of the skillet and the oil had separated leaving a wet, greasy mixture of chiles onions and tomatoes.  I hate being so negative but I really lost my appetite after this appetizer.\n\nWhat really sent me over the edge was when the Guacamole arrived - a perfect ice-cream scoop of guacamole that must have been served and stored in a very cold refrigerator long before our order was placed because their were ice crystals in the tomato garnish.\n\nThe only thing positive I can say is that they serve cold beer . . .""",nCeya29A,1344

My wife complained her basil chicken was too salty.  And even though I ordered medium spice, my curry wasn't hot at all.  It was also very soupy.  Not nearly enough chicken and vegetables.\n\nService also was indifferent.  It used to be a husband/wife.  I'd never seen this girl before, and she was not very attentive.\n\nKinda sad.

What I got concerned me to the point of asking one of their employees--fruit tasted acrid, of preservatives and like no fruit I want to taste again.  I learned from a manager/owner that contrary to their constant use of the word \fresh\"" on their website and branding, their \""fresh fruit\"" comes out of a can. I understand that this is the unfortunate reality in many restaurants...those, however, are restaurants that do not (and will not) receive my patronage.  NCounter can do better.

It is a remarkably good airport given the tremendous growth in the Valley of the Sun. \n\nThere are 3 terminals: \nTerminal 2, the smallest and oldest, (United, Continental, others)\nTerminal 3, next largest and oldest (Delta, Northwest and many others, including international flights)\nTerminal 4, newest and bigger than the others combined, dominated by SouthWest and US AIrways (formerly America West)\n\nFor locals, there are the West and East long term parking lots. You can park in the West and walk to Terminal 2; East is much larger with an annex and hi-rise, and closer to terminal 4, but you need to take the shuttles. To help you remember which is east and west, PHX names the shuttles Gecko, RoadRunner, and one other I can't remember! \n\nFor visitors, to get a round the sprawling valley, you need to rent a car. The recently added offsite Rental car Center is huge and well organized into 4 floors with different brands on each floor, and a lot of shuttle buses that are dedicated to each terminal. It is about 1 mile from the airport, but allow 10 minutes for shuttles and loading when you drop off your car. \n\nThey have recently upgraded Terminal 2, expanding the security area and remodeling the restaurant. Terminal 2 has little in the way of food and shops. Terminal 4, organized into 7 separate buildings of gates connected with long hallways and moving sidewalks, has more food and shopping choices, but not on the order of PDX, or DEN. Because of the sheer volume of flights, Term 4 can have a long security check-in line, so plan accordingly. \n\nIf you have questions, there are roaming information assistant volunteers, wearing blue sports coats and hats. Signage is decent and most monitors have been upgraded to flat screens. \n\nSky Harbor is located close to Tempe (ASU) and no too far from downtown PHX. The edge of Mesa and Scottsdale are about 5 miles away, but it is 20 or more miles from other parts of North Scottsdale, Deer Valley and North Phoenix. Overall, it is fairly well organized and a clean airport with a lot of flight options, especially on SouthWest or US Airways, who use it as a major hub. For other airlines with a smaller foothold, you have to often connect through LAX, DEN, SLC, ORD or SFO depending on your final destination.""",iG0Efbxr,1977

3247,2018-05-01 10:22:47,"Lovely!!  One of the area's most amazing nature walks sits just five minutes south of downtown Phoenix.  Here, gritty urban industrial meets nature, solitude, singing birds and running water.  You'll frequently exclaim \look! it's a bird!  It's a plane! \""  Literally.   \n\nAbundant bird life ( I spotted six white egrets, herons, cormorants, numerous waterfowl and birds of prey on a recent visit) as well as beaver, muskrat, coyote, rabbits.  Gorgeous stands of cottonwood trees and cattails that are just starting to grow back after the recent storms.  There are two levels of trails - a paved one that offers excellent panoramic views of the city skyline and south mountain range; and unpaved dirt-rock trails that lead you right into the river bottom.  Please be respectful of the request that dogs stay on the paved trails, as that is what helps preserve the amazing wild bird life that is here.  We counted 40 different kinds of birds on a recent walk.  \n\nThe preserve runs from 16 street to 19 ave, though the most visually interesting segment is central ave to about 15 ave.  Open sunrise to sunset with ample parking at central or 7th avenues.  Restrooms and water fountains and shade on the north side at both locations.  To cross to the other side of the river you must use the car overpasses at the major intersections, but there is safe pedestrian access in both directions.  The Audubon center on south side of central ave is also worth a brief visit.  Enjoy your stroll, hike, bike ride, birdwatching adventure, dog walk, or all of the above!""",LSLBQpG4,1189

3253,2018-01-17 23:41:41,"This is a great restaurant for women to go to while they are shopping at Scottsdale Fashion Square. It's a great menu for men because of the amount of red meat. See a problem there? I do, and it makes me upset to say, because I really want it to thrive. But when you make a restaurant which so heavily appeals to women, and then build the menu and style of cooking around men, it makes one wonder.\n\nI hope it works, because the dishes we tried were great and the typical hip, fun, happy Sam Fox atmosphere was there. The restaurant is what I would describe as \pretty\"" so it may not be a place for guys night out, but it would be ideal for a group of girls shopping, a guy picking his wife up after she shopped, or just anything that involves women. The bar was very different however, and gave a much more masculine feel, while in contrast to the restaurant it felt like the most masculine bar ever made. \n\nMy short rib was tender and delicious, and my girl's filet was one of the best she had in quite some time. We also enjoyed the cheesy potato side and the mushroom side. The bread they serve prior to the meal is stuffed with bacon (weird but oh so delicious.) BY FAR the highlight of the meal was the peanut butter cup, a dessert so delicious I can't even describe it.  The price point is WAY up there. $30-$75 for an entree which does not include sides, salad, or any extras.

3264,2018-04-08 02:56:14,"Took my folks to Tottie's for Father's Day. It's the perfect family restaurant. 4 different types of cuisine - Chinese, Thai, Japanese and Vietnemese, so there's something for all tastes.  It's unpretentious, reasonably priced, with friendly, efficient service. It's also not too noisy, and the tables are pretty well spaced apart.  We ordered some Chinese and Thai dishes, and the portions were large.  I was really pleased with the shrimp dishes.  They were fresh, juicy and thoroughly cleaned.  My only complaint with the food was that my dish had too much chili.  I had asked for \medium\"" and what I got was \""hot\"". Not inedibly hot, but definitely not medium.  I realize \""hot\"" and \""medium\"" are subjective, but I think it would be smarter for them to err on the side of less hot, and then let the customer add sriracha if they need it hotter.  \n\nThe other pet peeve was that although the server was very friendly and efficient, she wasn't able to make recommendations on some of the menu items.  I realize you are not going to a place like that for superior service, but I feel that the wait staff should at least have a grasp on some of the questions that come up, e.g. \""What wine/sake would you recommend with this dish...?\""\n\nThere are probably better Thai restaurants around, in terms of food, but this place just had a good vibe.  The owner Tottie even came over and asked how the meal was going, I saw her serving some regulars too, who seemed to be friends with her.  That's always a good sign to me too, because it shows the place is consistent.  I've had noodles to go before and they were really good too.\n\nIn summary, not a high-end restaurant, but definitely waaay better than a lot of the mom-and-pop Chinese restaurants around here.  In terms of Thai food, it's probably not the best either, but it's up there, and what it is lacking in food, is made up for in ambiance and  variety.""",ixlaCDHQ,4884

3266,2018-05-13 21:05:38,"I can't recommend this place.  While they have many lovely items, they have a \final sale\"" policy that they do not post or advertise.  Instead, they list it in very small type on their sales receipts.  Fortunately, I saw it before leaving the register today.  When I inquired, they verified that final sale meant that they don't accept returns or issue store credit.  I was surprised, given that it's a home design store, and customers can't exactly bring their houses shopping with them!  But a policy is a policy, so I simply asked them to cancel my sale right away.  I also suggested that they might want to post their final sale policy on the door or by the register so that they and their customers wouldn't waste their time, but they were pretty dismissive of the idea.  So please be advised that you absolutely can't buy anything that you aren't 100% certain looks great in your home!  The Great Indoors,  Holland Boone, Santa Fe Style, and Tlaquepaque are much more flexible and much better bets.

3268,2018-05-06 00:56:02,"Full thoughts blogged.\n\n...to call the concept, website, and descriptors of Cowboy Ciao eclectic would be an understatement to say the least - it is almost so \out there\"" that I'd considered skipping it entirely until one of my dining companions at Pizzeria Bianco suggested that not only was it worth inclusion on my agenda, but that he'd be glad to meet me for lunch - an offer I gladly accepted.  \n\nWith somewhat shaky padded wooden chairs at each table and a menu delivered at seating my friend and I sat browsing the interior of Peter Kasperski's 1997 space with some amusement; From Mardi Gras beads strewn across chandeliers to wall paintings befitting a mom n' pop Italian space to the largely western themed exposed brick and stucco apparently little has changed in the intervening 15 years.  Chuckling to myself as I opened the menu with quotations ranging from Spaceballs to The Addams family it would be mere moments before our server, John, would stop by to fill our water and announce the daily specials.  With the afternoon crowd clearly slow and John, a good waiter but a bit more corny than would have been preferred, ever present it would be mere moments before we were ready to order and confirming all our choices as \""excellent\"" we were left to chat\n\nDiscussing real estate, travel, and the area of Old-town Scottsdale it would be a mere 15 minutes before our first courses would arrive and for my appetizer I selected Duck Confit Relleno with roasted shallots, queso Oaxaca, cheddar, and roasted guajillo-tomatillo salsa, I will fully admit that I ordered this dish largely based on the fowl but what I received turned out to be large, bold, and unexpectedly quite sweet.  Beginning first with the Relleno itself, a cored pasilla chili pepper absolutely stuffed with confit and cheese then fried and coated with even more cheese the flavor was exemplary.  With fresh sliced avocado and the squeaky cheese taming the pepper while the crisp duck nicely juxtaposed the creamy cheddar it was the green salsa that really served as the most surprising part of this dish - an acidic pineapple flavor with a slightly heated finish.\n\nFor ours second course we'd see Cowboy Ciao's most famous dishes - first the \""Stetson Chopped,\"" I had the opportunity to watch the beautifully arranged salad of couscous, arugula, tomato, cheese, pepitas, corn, salmon, and currants come together before my eyes.  Never one to be wowed by a salad, particularly one with a mayo based dressing I will admit that the presentation and composition of this dish did intrigue me enough to take a couple of bites and while indeed a salad I could just as easily make at home I really did love the variety of textures and flavors hiding beneath a dressing that although hefty was quite refreshing with notes of basil, onion, garlic, and lemon beneath the slightly sour creamy tones.\n\nIf the Stetson is not Cowboy Ciao's most fabled item then my main course most certainly was, a dish described simply as the Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry.  Again topped with chopped avocados, cheese, and tomatoes and consisting of \""mucho mushrooms (including cremini, button, oyster, cepe, lobster, black trumpet, shiitake, morel, yellow foot)\"" in ancho cream over double-cooked polenta the pan fry would prove to be many things, not the least of which being the richest vegetarian dish I've ever tasted.  Beginning first with the mushrooms - a blend I have a hard time calling exotic as each can be found at your local Whole Foods - I will admit that the variety of flavors and textures were truly impressive, particularly as they related to the hearty and complex sauce.  With each bite a different experience depending on the balance of mushrooms and vegetables this was exactly the sort of dish I love though I really could have done without the polenta - a thick gob that was so wet it did nothing to soak up any of the sauce and as such tasted like a wet sponge in the middle of the dish.\n\nHaving requested some bread to assist in sopping up the rest of the ancho cream (bread that is 'baked to order,' largely flavorless on its own, and an unlisted $2 for three meager rolls) John would arrive as my friend was finishing his salad and I was sopping up the last of my sauce to ask if we would be interested in dessert and with my love of bread pudding well documented I selected \""Bread Pudding Overboard\"" which arrived on a large plate in a relatively modest portion. .  Beginning first with buttery brioche - the sort they should have served instead of those dinner rolls - nicely soaked in caramel custard and dotted with dried cherries, craisins, and pine nuts the steaming hot bread pudding was of good quality and firm texture; a good but not stunning representation on its own.  Moving next to the toppings - a trio of brown sugar streusel, praline cream, and American Oak ice cream the overall effect was sweet, sweet, and sweet - not inherently a bad thing, but a bit of overkill.""",HVyk59HI,1348

Was a little taken aback by the mandatory valet parking but relaxed when I saw it was complimentary - a very nice touch. \n\nThe place was crowded with people who all seemed (for lack of a better word) relaxed. Well heeled too I'm sure. I was going to a college alumnae club event, but wasn't sure I would go so far for brunch on my own. \n\nOnce we went into the building, it was really cool to imagine it being someone's private home - it was very welcoming! As were the people. The friendliness and quality of service was excellent. \n\nHowever, given the price, I was very surprised and disappointed with the food. For brunch, there was a plate of small breakfast breads on the table - for 8 people we each got one. No one asked if we wanted more, or offered the fruits or breakfast meats included in the brunch. \n\nWe also had our choice of 3 possible entrees. Being on an Eggs Benedict kick, I naturally gravitated to that. Mentally, I had a moment of fondly remembering the Daily Dose with their 7 options - here there was one.  \n\nWhen it came, it was short on Hollandaise. There was a tiny pile of potatoes on the side, mixed with some orange (squash?) vegetables. Now, at the risk of sounding really nit-picky, but I would have liked to know what \hacienda potatoes\"" were before getting them and the option to get them plain. The whole plate (artistic vision aside) just looked empty before I even touched it ... \nAnyway, the potatoes were left. I left hungry.\n\nMH's strawberry and mascarpone stuffed brioche french toast was ok, too sweet for my taste. \n\nGiven the gaps in what they advertised and what we were offered, I figured it was roughly an extra $12 per person for unlimited coffee and the one pastry. \n\nThe coffee was surprisingly good. We filled up at a central station, and the server refilled our cups for us. Very nice of him, since he had to walk to the urn for each cup. No cream on the table - surprising - so he had to make a couple repeat trips. Not for me, after the first time - I hate to put people out to do things like this for me - but you'd think it would be better planned. \n\nSo my experience was mixed. Surroundings and service awesome - food not so much. Value for money - very low. If I enjoyed everything it would have been worth it but as it was, no. If I had a choice I would rather go to Daily Dose and donate the difference balance to charity.""",yrx6CElK,138

Since I'm going on va-ca I wanted to spice it up a bit. So I asked for a few pink streaks. Needless to say, the 3+ hrs I spent there was a total waste of time! When she put the blonde on my hair I sat there, not under a dryer because of course they didn't have one, for almost 2 hrs! By the time it was done, my hair didn't look like it had been touched! The pink pieces were ok, it just kind of got on other pieces of hair. It was really sloppy. The haircut was just your run of the mill basic cost cutters. Nothing special. Kinda choppy. When I left my hair was still wet, and not styled. When I got home and actually dried and straightened my hair, I was so mad! My gf suggested I call back and see if they could fix it. SO I called the next day and the phone rang and rang and rang. It went to voicemail. SO I left a message. I never got a call back, so I called back a couple hours later. When I called back I talked to the stylist and she told me that she had put the blonde highlights in and I could come back for more if I liked. I asked her how much it would be (mistakenly thinking she would fix for free since I sat there for 2 hrs for NOTHING) and she said it would be $55 and since I was just there, they would give me half off again. Needless to say, I didn't schedule. I rather put my money to someone who is willing to keep my business.""",QShGixeS,168

We wandered around for a bit, I found a bottle of Argyle bubbly that I wanted, and then began to stare with lust in my eyes at the selection of Absinthe. \n\nGirlfriend wandered over to ask the guy to recommend a white that wasn't a Chard as we both really don't like buttery oak anything. He took a few cues from her, and found a great bottle of white which we drank with great glee last night. \n\nThis was a test for the guy behind the counter. She didn't set a price limit, just said \show me your favorite.\"" He could have done what many others have in the past and shown us a $50 bottle, but instead he showed us a kick ass bottle at the $14 price point. This is the mark of a good wine seller. Find you what you want without bending you over on the price. Yes, sometimes I want to spend $400 a bottle, but not all that often. I'd rather get my drink on at the price he found, and he turned us onto a white we both REALLY liked, which is super rare as we have very different tastes.\n\nWe'll absolutely be going back to buy more fermented grape from this place!\n\nPrices are on par with Total Wine, but what you're really paying for is the help of someone who knows what they sell and likes their job.

My buddy was hungry so we checked out all the food vendors of which some looked good, some smelled great, but I knew there were better things to be found in the Super L.\n\nTwo parts to this hidden gem. One of them is a \panda express style\"" hot food line. Premade dishes that can be ordered in one, two, or three item combos. This stuff is decent, quick, and inexpensive but this isn't what you want....\n\nYou want the BBQ meats hanging up in the hot box. The peaking duck, bbq pork, bbq chicken, and various roast pig parts. It's all sold by the pound and will be chopped and thrown in a to go container.\n\nContinue down the line and you will find an order counter with a large display menu and an even larger non pictured menu. This is all made to order gastrohappiness. You'll find everything from the Americanized dishes to the crazy things you see them eat on your favorite travel channel/discovery shows.\n\nI agree fully with NormR, although the quality and taste is good/great, they still fall a bit short of the amazing Asian food that can be found on the east coast.\n\nMy friend, being from that side of the country, is always craving and constantly let down by the General Tso's chicken throughout the valley. He ordered it here, extra spicy, and he got what he asked for. His dish smelled so good that several random people in line asked him what he ordered so they could get the same. It was probably the best Tso's I've tasted since living in NYC. Sweet, spicy, carb load, artery clogging masterpiece :) \n\nI decided to get some of the BBQ pork from the hot box. It was very tasty and although had plenty of fat on it was on the lean side in comparison to most establishments. It had been cooked nice and slow and the glaze had caramelized to the pork just like it should. It had a very curious, but not unpleasant crunchy texture to the fat.\n\nIf I allowed myself to take pleasure in food regularly this would be a frequent stop on my lunch hour.

Make sure you stick with black coffee if you want to get a sweet crepe. My sister went for a more simpler crepe; the \""sugar and cinnamon\"". She also raved about the texture and perfect sweetness. Next time I go back I think I'll try a savory crepe.  The atmosphere is really laid back, fairly quite unless someone orders something blended.

3348,2018-01-27 06:49:23,"I admit it.  I'm a pizza snob.  I grew up in New Jersey and know the difference between good pizza and bad pizza.  Good pizza is \anything you could serve in Lodi, N.J. and not have your body found in the dumpster behind the store the next morning.\""  Bad pizza constitutes about 99.999% of the rest of the pizza in the world.  \n\nHaving voluntarily moved out of N.J. at age 18 to attend college (I didn't feel the need to major in herpes, Camaro repair, or ab workouts, so my options were severely limited there), I was taken aback at the culinary wasteland that exists west of the Passaic river.  I found this abomination called \""frozen pizza\"" in grocery stores under names like Red Baron and the very appropriately named \""Tombstone.\""  I found racks of pizza-like-substances in truck stops, obviously part of a nefarious plan to punish the bathroom attendants working there.  And worst of all, there were restaurants called \""Pizza Hut,\"" which emanated a neon red siren-call to me as I drove down the highway.  In what I attribute mostly to road-hypnosis (staring at the white dotted line for hours at a time), the talking koala bear in my passenger seat finally convinced me to stop at one of these places.  After being slapped back into reality by ingesting over a half-gallon of pure grease, and utterly disgusted with my furry friend's trickery, I snuck out when he went to the little-koala-bear's-room and peeled out of the parking lot, sticking him with the bill.  I hope washing those dishes ruined his fur.  \n\nFrom that point on, rather than return to New Jersey (as if that were a viable option), I decided to scour the vast majority of this great nation in search of edible pizza.  I spent many of those years living with soul-crushing disappointment.  \n\nLucky for me, I finally found Lucky's.  The owners have cleverly tucked this gem away in a strip mall 20+ miles out of the burgeoning metropolis that is Phoenix, Arizona, where damn near no one who lives in the entire valley will ever find it.  Hell, most people who live in Phoenix couldn't find Surprise without a GPS, so the chances of someone from Mesa or Chandler wandering in are roughly the same as being given the winning Powerball ticket by a lonely koala covered in pizza grease and dishwashing detergent.  \n\nAfter one taste, I was hooked.  After living less than a mile away from the place for the past decade, I'm pretty sure I've financed at least one of the cars parked outside of it.  Mercifully, they don't deliver, otherwise I'm not sure I could fit through my front door at this point.  \n\nFrom reading other yelp reviews, it appears that Lucky's has other items on the menu.  I never noticed.""",KADBjusL,1181

If you are going for a night out, forget a taxi, this is the only way to go!  In Scottsdale, you have 4 options for getting home from the bars/clubs after you've indulged on one too many adult beverages:\n\n1) Make a friend drive you home, who is sober (or less drunk...)\n2) Pay a ridiculous amount for a taxi (gets expensive when you don't actually live in Old Town)...or even more expensive a towncar/limo\n3) Drive yourself home and get a DUI, setting you back at least $10k (not to mention all the other lifelong hassles a DUI provides)...((oh and let's not forget the chance of you actually killing someone or yourself))\n4) Call up Drunk Drivers and have them drive you home in your OWN car\n\nLet's see...the problem with #2 for me is cost.  Sure a $50 cab ride to North Scottsdale would be cheaper than a $10k+ DUI...but ugh, the next morning I either have to a) get another cab back down to get my car which is still sitting in an Old Town parking garage (with the possibility that it got damaged or broken into by drunk d-bags) or b) beg your hungover friends to drive you down and get your car in said garage.  Too much $$ for #2 and although free, #1 is too much of a hassle the next day.  That leaves #3 and #4....pretty sure #3 is self explanatory...I'll just say no thanks to that one.  Leaves us at #4...the AMAZING option!\n\nThey have an incredible response time...you can just call them when you need them, and they will meet you at your car usually within 15-20 min (a lot of times its even shorter).  From there hand them the keys and your on your way to wherever you want to go (home), you arrive in one piece, DUI free, and without that initial hungover thought in the morning of \ugggggh...i need to go all the way back down to Old Town to get my car....who can I bug to drive my pathetic self down there?\""\n\nThey work off a flat rate to go anywhere within 10 miles...and let me tell you I live about 11 miles from Old Town, and its WAAYYY cheaper and way more convenient to take Drunk Drivers, than to take a gross cab.  As an added bonus, the girls that own the company are simply two of the nicest, most fun people you could ever meet...who really take great pride in making sure you and your car get home safely.""",qI32KfWX,4647

Menu essentially the same as the Scottsdale location. Otherwise same excellent pizza, service, atmosphere. Parking could be a problem at times. \nFresh local ingredients, fast service, and family atmosphere are the hallmarks of Humble Pie. Crust is thick at the edges, thin in the center. As a former Chicagoan the adjustment to thin crust was much easier with this quality dining spot. Love their salads too.\n I recommend the pepperoni pizza because it is not topped with conflicting flavors. The Sausage and Fennel would be much better without the fennel. I realize American tastes have moved towards \scented\"" and \""sweeter\"", but I have not. So don't be afraid to ask if the pizza you will be ordering has any non-traditional flavors. Would you order a Super Supreme Pizza Hut pizza and sprinkle mint or lavender on it? At this place they would, so beware before you order.  Plan to order 1 pizza per adult. If you order carry-out, it only takes about 12 minutes to make a to-go pizza.\nMy only actual complaint about H.P. is the cramped dining area. And when the booze is flowing heavy the place gets loud.\n\nWording on the menu can be a bit confusing... you can add ingredients (pizza toppings) but you cannot substitute. You should research the menu online before going here. And their Sunday closing time online is not correct, so if you're going late - call first.\n\nNo delivery at this location.""",K5vYmKWj,4728

But I stand by my decision that once this voucher is used, I will never darken their door again. \n\nThanks but no thanks.\n\n***later that day (because i finally actually went into the email) *** GASP!

The menu is horrible with very little choices and geared towards how men eat. Very lame and the prices are outrageous but of course they can get away with it since it is at the airport. I ordered a lime infused chicken an brie sandwich but I ordered it without the chibatta bun because the last thing I want is a huge sandwich before I get on a plane. I am actually eating this right now. So far I have received a dry piece of chicken with caramelized, barely, red onion, roasted red pepper that I wouldn't call roasted at all. I couldn't taste any lime at all, they left off the \chiffonade\"" of fresh basil, the brie and the garlic aioli mayonnaise! Are you kidding me! What about \""no bun\"" does the kitchen not understand? I got the brie and the aioli served on the side, the brie was cold of course. Hello, melted brie it says on the menu and it was some weird brie spread, totally gross. I sent the whole thing back to be melted and it was redelivered to me in, I swear, less than a minute.

3405,2018-05-26 08:33:19,"I admit it. I'm a romantic. Sometimes I give my heart away too easily to a handsome french fry here, or a buff egg roll there, only to have it broken on our second meeting. The french fry has gone limp, the egg roll greasy. That's why I forced myself to hold back after going to Little Saigon the first time. I had to see how I'd feel on our next date. Now I'm ready.\n\nThe place is really cute. It's in one of the little houses that make up much of downtown Glendale's shopping district. You'd expect to be served Irish stew or corned beef and cabbage here. There are lace curtains in the windows and potted fake plants scattered about. But the food is Vietnamese, and lots of it, too. You can order by number, or enjoy feeling foolish trying to pronounce the Vietnamese names of the dishes correctly - all one hundred and one of them. So far we've tried eight.\n\nThe dish that first delighted us was #62, bo cuon la nho ($9.99), This, of course, is marinated beef wrapped in grape leaves and served with rice noodles and \paper\"". It comes, as do many of the dishes, with a large helping of fresh-as-can-be romaine lettuce leaves, mint, thai basil, coriander, and sliced carrots and cucumbers. It it looks like you're going to run out of greens, the pleasant servers (none of them Vietnamese) happily bring you more. The beef is tender and flavorful, contrasting nicely with the brininess and chew of the grape leaves. On our second visit,  Ken ordered #55, black peppered bite-size pork ribs with caramelized onions ($6.99). It was served in a pot which came boiling to the table. The broth was delectable, flavored by the onions, and the ribs were falling off the bone with just the right jolt of pepper.\n\nI decided to order two appetizers - egg rolls ($4.99) and banh xeo ($7.99), which are rice flour crepes filled with pork, shrimp and bean sprouts. The egg rolls were good, but not noteworthy. The crepes were delicious. I've had them at other places and they usually arrive at the table soggy from the filling. These were perfectly dry and crisp, despite the load of meat and veggies. Our friend Sue, who was with us on our first visit and happily came on the second, had the fried rice bowl ($6.99) both times, so we plied her with our goodies. I bet the next time she'll go with the ribs.\n\nThere are 10 variations of Pho, with rice noodles, and 5 more soups made with egg noodles. Then there are 6 hot pot soups. Many dishes are served over rice, and others with stir fry noodles. Catfish is done 4 ways and shrimp 3. There are 3 green mussel salads and 5 mixed salads including one with jellyfish. I could go on, but if you go on line, you can see the menu for yourself.\n\nAs I mentioned above, the servers are friendly and attentive. They actually remembered our names and what we had eaten on our first visit. We had directed other friends to Little Saigon that night, and the servers remembered them, too. The portions are large, the ingredients fresh. And there's even a cute patio. I think I'm ready to commit.""",1BXNrHeP,3480

A little snack and some wine out on the patio sounded great to me, so I went over to Bomberos.\n\nIt was early in the day, so they weren't at all busy, there were only a couple of other customers either inside or out.  I walked in and out between the patio and the inside seating area several times over a few moments, purposefully contorting my face into the restaurant patron's \where do I go?\"" look.  Since the server's work station and door to the kitchen area were in that narrow hallway, I actually was in the way of the couple of servers who were there trying to move to and from the two dining areas.\n\nI did not get greeted at all, either before or after I had to stop one of them and ask for a menu. \n\nI sat and reviewed the menu for a several minutes, all the while continuing my confused, helpless patron routine.\n\nNothing.\n\nWith nary a peep out of the servers, I walked away.\n\nMy tendency to frequent $ instead of $$$$ places comes less from a lack of means than it does from my countless experiences that what you get for your $$$$ is often not worth it.  \nIf I have a 2* experience at a $ restaurant, I may be a little upset, but if I have a 2* experience at a $$$$ establishment, I'm going to be postally pioughd.\n\nBomberos may treat you like one of the Sunnyslope Elite, if you show up looking like you are one of the Sunnyslope Elite.  Maybe then their overpriced wine and admittedly tasty looking nosh might seem worth it.

Before I could get the bottom of the chip bowl my dinner was already on it's way over.

It was no better than your local hole in the wall joint where the same meal will be much cheaper.\n\nThe restaurant itself was pleasantly odd.

3414,2018-04-20 07:32:00,"This review is a little overdue (I went over two months ago) but that doesn't take away any of the fun my family and I had while we were there. We found Vertuccio Farms on Groupon and they were offering a great deal for the whole family we couldn't pass up. So one Saturday morning many weeks back we took a drive out to Gilbert to visit the farm. I think we went the last weekend that it was open for the season. \n\nThe place was not very crowded, which I liked. It was however pretty muddy and wet because of the rain that had fallen before we came. The staff was trying to keep the mud under control with hay but it wasn't working out so well. But it wasn't so bad that we couldn't have a good time. \n\nThe very first thing we did when we walked in was ride the barrel train around the farm. You get one ride included in your ticket price. This was pretty fun, though my motion sickness acted up (I am pretty sensitive about moving in things that don't use my legs). So we got to see all of the activities available without having to walk around. And we did pretty much all of the rest of the activities while we were there. There were bouncy horses, which I did not participate in but the rest of my family thought they were hysterical. Some pedal bikes, a large bouncy area for kids, a small playground, farm animal feedings. There is a thing they call a \pizza farm\"". From the website: \""What is a Pizza Farm? The pizza farm is a one-half acre circular garden that is divided into eight pie shaped \""slices\"" (like a pizza) and grows or grazes all the ingredients needed to make a farm fresh pizza! You will learn how farmers grow wheat for the crust, tomatoes for the sauce..dairy cows or goats that give milk to make cheese, pigs for pepperoni, and much more!\"" This was pretty fun. I always like to look at growing vegetables and herbs. There is even a large 10 acre corn maze that has a different design every year. \n\nWe all had a pretty good time here and would come back again in the future. My three year old niece was pretty excited by everything here. So not only a good time for kids, it was fun for the four adults in our party as well.""",IfktYcZo,2235

3416,2018-02-13 10:00:36,"Yes, it's a chain... but there are some good chains. This is one of those places that has such a gargantuan menu with so much goodness that you want to go back just to try everything that you missed on the first run.  The appetizer offerings had so much I wanted to try, particularly the fried alligator; however, this time we tried the mussels, which were delicious.  I'm pretty picky about mussels, I don't like when they are small and have that graininess when you bite into them.  The mussels at Pappadeaux were fantastic -- large in size, very mild, without any graininess whatsoever.   \n\nI ordered the Big Bay Platter for the main course, which comes with Montage Shrimp (jumbo shrimp stuffed with crab), 3 small Caribbean lobster tails, and grilled shrimp.  The price was reasonable for the amount of seafood, about $25.95 and I was really happy with the dish.  The shrimp montage were delicious, stuffed with generous portion of crab meat; the lobster was pretty good, and the grilled shrimp were basted with a spicy sauce that was very tasty.  This was all served on a bed of dirty rice and green beans.  There is so much more I want to come back and try, like the alligator, and some of the other entrees.  \n\nA few tips:\n\n- Get there early or call ahead to get your name on the list, this place gets packed.\n\n-  be prepared that it's very loud in here, especially when they have the \New Orleans trio\"" band playing.  \n\n- Watch out for the parking lot, it's like a parking lot at the mall on black Friday. You've been warned.\n\nI will definitely return to Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen.""",09bDNGEC,925

I took a bite of each dish and didn't taste anything that resembled what I ordered so I called the waitress over. \n\nShe apoplized and said she switched our dish with another table...hence the weird look when she asked how our meal was.

We told her everything was fine when she asked.\n\n\n\nEveryone at the table scraped that portion of the food back onto the serving dish to appease the manager. She didn't budge on her opinion. \n\nI had taken one bite of everything. I am not sure that everyone else had even tried the dish. So...the platter was almost full again and yet still rejected by them. What's with these people? Can they not afford to make a customer happy after they make a mistake? \n\nThe manager refused to give us the right dish without charging us for the wrong dish AND the right dish.

Expensive 1 bite meal! \n\nWhat kind of place is this?\n\nDon't ever eat here!\n\nAnd  when a waitress asks you how everything is, be very careful! If you haven't tried everything yet, send her away and tell her to return again when you can give her a comprehensive answer. When you say \fine\"" at the bamboo grill it is a verbal contract to pay for everything they set down, even if you ordered chicken and they give you pork. Hope you're not Jewish. :)\n\nThe waitress should have fessed up her mistake. What if one of us was allergic to one of the ingredients she served us? It's Asian food with sauce...not that easy to tell what's all in there. Plus we recgnized the mistake in just a few bits. It's not like we ate the entire dish and asked for our money back. I am a reasonable person. I would have been very satisfied if they took the other food away and simply gave me what I ordered...and only charged me for what I ordered. It's okay to make mistakes. It's not okay to not make your mistakes right.\n\nIf they are this rude to your face imagine what they do behind the scene. A lack of integrity will make it's way into your food. I promise.

But something changed as an adult.  Now, I am much more adventurous when it comes to food. (Except for ketchup. I still can't eat that stuff!)\n\nSo, when it comes to trying new restaurants and foods, I am more than happy to take a risk. And, that is what led me to Breadfruit.  Yeah, Jamaican food isn't like a culinary feat, and although I love Cuban food (a cousin to Jamaican food, you could say), I'd never ventured to the spicier side of Caribbean cuisine. But, WOW, I'm so glad I did!\n\nIt was a lovely Friday afternoon, when a work friend suggested we head over to Breadfruit for a long, leisurely lunch. And, I must say Breadfruit was a great antidote to a stressful work week. After waiting just a little too long for our menus, we were greeted by a friendly waiter who gave us some recommendations on drinks. My friend had the carrot-coconut juice -- he loves his carrot juice, so he was thrilled they had it on the menu and loved every sip of it. I, on the other hand, just had their house iced tea. They had a lot of other beverage options, I just wanted to avoid something too sweet. \n\nThere was a decent selection of menu choices and everything sounded delicious, so it was tough for me to decided which meal would whet my appetite.  My friend had the jerk chicken, which he said was spicy (of course) but fantastic. I had the brown stew chicken, and in my best Rachel Zoe, it was BA-na-NAs!  The chicken was cooked wonderfully and the flavorful sauce was so complex and delicious my taste buds sang a glorious \""Hallelujah!\"" \n\nI can't wait to go back and try more from their menu.  I was totally eying the plantain avocado spring rolls -- LOVE plantains and LOVE avocados, so I know I would LOVE this!  And, I was really wanting to try the curried chicken dumplings, but I was afraid if I had that for lunch I would be in a food coma for the rest of the day.\n\nYou know a place is good, while during your first visit, you are already planning what your next meal will be!

3452,2018-03-31 08:31:11,"This is definitely comparable to Paradise Bakery or Panera Bread, except that it's not a national chain (just Phoenix), which is always nice to patronize.\nBut it's also a bit better. I go to Panera Breads in various parts of the country to use their free wifi (which is also available here at Wildflower), but rarely actually eat there because it's just not that good. Paradise is just gross most of the time, and I'll only eat there if I have a coupon.\nWhere Wildflower separates itself from these places is the quality of the food: it's pretty good. The mass of sweets conveniently laid out at the entrance leads you to believe this right away. There are some great-looking cakes and breads, and they have some wonderful looking cinnamon rolls.\nBut you're probably going for the breakfast. The nice thing about this place, tucked back into a newer strip mall on Indian School west of 44th, is that it shares its parking lot with a primarily dinner restaurant and a Cold Stone, both of which are not likely to be crowded at breakfast time. And this leaves plenty of parking in an otherwise relatively small lot.\nThe place is busy and full of kids. There are booths on the walls, big tables in the middle, a small sidewalk patio outside and a big, round table in the middle of it all, strewn with newspapers and magazines. It's comfortable, although a bit frantic and noisy.\nI had the sausage and egg sandwich and a side of home fries, although you shouldn't believe for a second that it was simply a sausage and egg sandwich. It was more of a sausage omelet sandwich, as, mixed in with the eggs were cheese, green onions and red peppers, all on a ciabatta roll. It was nice for what it was, but I will say that I was disappointed by the sausage, which was definitely frozen and a little lifeless.\nThe home fries were good, but overpriced: the tiny plate cost me $2. But I got approximately 1/2 red potato lightly fried (not greasy in the least) loaded with rosemary and possibly a little garlic. Very good.\nMy companion had the ham and egg sandwich which, unfortunately, was exactly that: ham and eggs. To be fair, the ham was very good and had an excellent flavor, but it was just dull compared to my sandwich.\nAnd especially compared to some of the other options. Honey-Cured Ham & Brie Frittata? Feta & Roasted Vegetable Frittata? Yum! Then there were also interesting sounding pancakes and a french toast option. Very nice!\nNot much of a service place. You order up front and your food is brought to you. You're then left alone. I asked for ketchup and tabasco for my home fries, and was told that I couldn't get my own but that it would be brought to me. It never came, but that was fine, because I ended not needing them.\nI also take issue with the fact that they call theirs a \homestyle\"" breakfast. I'm not sure from which home they came, but, at my house, we did not cook breakfasts which involved brie, roasted tomato or lemon ricotta. Maybe I was disadvantaged, but I think of \""homestyle\"" as simple eggs, bacon, toast and maybe some sort of potato or biscuit dish.\nIt's not a bad thing to not be served a mound of greasy, homestyle goodness on a morning when I would rather eat otherwise, but I feel that it's misleading to refer to this as such.\nAlso, for Tucsonans, this is completely unrelated to the \""Wildflower\"" there, but that becomes very obvious as soon as you see this place.""",AVla1el8,3191

I'm giving it 3 because the food was decent, the beer selection was insane, and its convenient for brew and view.  To see why its not 4 stars read on....\n\nI went with my husband on a Friday around 3:30 for their happy hour to get toasty before seeing a movie - a pretty convenient location for that.  When we first got in, I remarked how I couldn't believe there was a woman at the bar with her friend and her infant child in a stroller next to them.  Something I'm not used to seeing but the place was pretty empty at that point so I disregarded it.  (Even though if I came with a baby in a stroller- which I would not-  I would choose to sit at one of the 50 empty tables and not AT the bar, but that's just me.)\n\nThe place was big and as I said mostly empty, and somehow the hostess still managed to seat us in an area with no waitress.  After eyeing a few of them as they walked by our table to help the tables around us, one finally came over to us - \Is anyone helping you?  I can go figure out who is supposed to be your waitress.\""  No, you are going to take our order.\n\nLike I said, the food honestly was pretty good.  We had the chicken lettuce wraps which had a ton of pine nuts (yum!) and came with three delicious dipping sauces - hoisin, peanut satay, and a sweet and spicy.  We also had the chicken nachos and onion rings which were average.  The onion rings were served with your choice of dipping sauces- ranch or slightly pink ranch.  (I like to call it Ranch Rose)  I would highly suggest they develop a horseradish dipping sauce.  \n\nOverwhelmed by the beer selection, my husband asked for a recommendation, saying he usually goes for the lagers, pale ales, and amber ales, and the waitress had no clue what he should get, only that \""I remember someone ordering one of the pale ales earlier and didn't like it.\""  Ok. . .I ordered a rum and coke, seeing as well drinks were supposed to be $4 for the happy hour special.  We got out beverages and I tasted my drink and thought the bartender screwed up and put stoli vanilla in it - my husband tasted it and agreed.  Oh well, I'm not one to complain.  When ordering our second round, I specifically emphasized \""ANOTHER RUM and coke.\""  This time, a bus boy brought our drinks to us and handed me the glass and said \""Your Captain and coke.\""  Here's a lesson to all the waitresses out there - when your special is $4 well drinks and your clientele doesn't specify the brand of alcohol they want, that means \""well liquor.\""  Don't substitute it with \""top shelf\"" liquor (if you can call Captain that) and definitely DON'T substitute regular rum with spiced rum.  \""Captain and Coke\"" is a VERY specific drink.  \""Rum and Coke\"" is not.  \n\nIt turned from bad to worse when the kid in the booth behind us decided to toss his straw over and it hit me in the head.  I turned and scoured at the table of parents and they shrugged it off and pointed to the kid as if to say, \""Oh it wasn't our fault, he was just a kid.\""  For all the parents reading this, if your children can't behave and you can't control them, don't bring them to happy hour.  It is NOT okay to shrug off bad behavior like that.  If it were my child, I would demand he apologize to whomever he hit.\n\nWhen we got the bill, I was glad to see that I was charged the full price for my \""rum and cokes.\""  Stellar, exactly why I came to happy hour.  As we left, the place had filled in pretty well, and I saw ANOTHER stroller with a baby in it, only this time the parents were just standing around not even in seats or at the bar! (They also had a toddler who was sitting on the floor of the bar area.)  I'm sorry, I'm just appalled.  I've never seen babies saddling up to a bar before.

Ironically, I don't think anyone in our karaoke group of 12 was gay,but it didn't matter.

How about with the amuse busch (to build anticipation in the palette).  Moments after we received the menu a plate arrived with a couple wonderfully pungent olives, several small slices of some kind of salami and 4 small chunks of what I believe was pecorino cheese.  A delicious start and we had barely opened the menu.\n\nWe shared the Gamberi e Feta antipasti.  Two HUGE jumbo shrimp (I didn't think the word jumbo really did those bad boys justice) grilled perfectly...tender and juicy.  They were served on a square of lightly fried feta cheese and a bed of cabbage.  The arrangement was so nice that I didn't want to disturb it.\n\nAfter that we shared 2 entrees:\n\nThe Fagottino di Pollo and the Salmone in Crosta di Porcini con Cognac e Porri.  I am not a big fan of salmon but I could become a fan of this salmon.  Flaky, delicious fillet with a wonderful cognac sauce.  I was less thrilled with the chicken.  It was split chicken breasts layered with proscuitto and fontina cheese and smothered in a brown sauce.\n\nHere's the thing about the Fagottino di Pollo.  When I say I was less thrilled I mean it was 4 star chicken.  Everything else about the food and service was 5 stars.  Flat out.  \n\nWe shared a couple desserts - a tirimisu and a dark chocolate mousse.  The tirimisu had all the right flavors working - mascarpone cheese, chocolate, espresso, rum, lady fingers.  Delicious.  The mousse was also very good.  Dangerously good.\n\nAlong the way we had a very well rounded chianti ( Chianti \I Sodi\"", Badia Morrona ) and a very nice white ( Albana \""Colle Del Re\"" ).  Even the brewed coffee I had after dessert was very good.\n\nService was outstanding throughout the evening.

3489,2018-01-21 14:29:24,"Bland and lackluster food that is not worth the price or the wait to get it.  We had lunch at Nourish a few months ago and while we weren't overly impressed, as they do serve healthy food that is in line with our whole foods, plant-based eating habits, we decided to give them another shot and went for brunch a few weekends ago.  I ordered the egg sandwich, which is described as an air-fried egg, avocado, and tomato on a gluten free bagel with a side of sweet potato hash.  As I have never found gluten free bread products to be very mouth-watering, I asked to substitute multi-grain bread in place of the bagel, as the bread had previously been the best part of the lunch sandwich that I'd had.  The server informed me that they were out of bread (how does a restaurant run out of bread when half of their menu items are sandwiches? very poor planning by management) and that the only other item available was a wheat bun, which I opted for.  My husband ordered the veggie quiche, which is described as zucchini, asparagus, caramelized onion, parmesan, and a quinoa crust. \n\nAfter an incredibly long wait (the restaurant was less than 1/3 full), our food finally arrived.  My egg sandwich was by far the most flavorless breakfast item I have ever consumed.  The air-fried egg had sounded appealing as it would be healthy and not greasy, which was the case, however I didn't realize that this also meant there would be absolutely no seasoning on it or flavor to it at all.  The sweet potato hash was downright disgusting and I only consumed a cube or two of the mushy, flavorless heap that was on my plate.  As bad as my meal was, my husband's veggie quiche definitely won the award for worst breakfast item ever tasted.  The \quinoa crust\"" which we were looking forward to as we love quinoa dishes, was actually undercooked quinoa mixed throughout the entire quiche with no visible crust present, which gave the whole thing a granular texture equivalent to fine gravel having been poured into the dish.  The vegetables almost appeared to be ground up as there was just an overall green appearance to the egg portion with no discernible pieces of the veggies described on the menu actually present.  The dish in general had a strange taste and the off-putting texture from the quinoa was more than I could handle even in just the one bite that I tasted.  I honestly don't know how my husband even managed to choke down the portion of the quiche that he did.\n\nWe also each had two bloody marys while we were there and while each took an incredibly long time to get, the first one was flavorful and seemed to be made \""extra spicy\"" as we requested, however, the second one was flavorless and tasted like watered down tomato juice.  While Nourish has a nice patio and offers a view of the lush foliage present in the complex, these elements are not enough to bring us back after we left with our tastebuds reeling in horror over the flavors, or lack thereof, of our brunch.""",TRI9zJRQ,1963
3490,2018-01-06 07:07:04,"Local Breeze Patio Cafe is one of the coolest restaurants you'll ever visit in downtown Phoenix!  \n\nThe wife and I literally stumbled into Local Breeze, 606 N. 4th Ave., Phoenix (on the corner of 4th Avenue and Fillmore Street), several days ago and felt like we found a little gold mine. \n\nLocal Breeze opened in May 2009 and is quartered in a restored, historic home that was built in 1914. Even though the home was built almost 100 years ago, it has a modern, unique feel to it. Sorry, I never heard of Palatte!\n\nIn the patio area which is expansive, I felt like I was thrust into a little piece of the Caribbean in the desert. There was a large lattice patio cover, trees, string lights, fans, candles and comfortable outdoor furniture everywhere. \n\nThe outdoor patio is perfect for having a drink with close friends - especially at night. In fact, I think I want to have my next PhxSoul.com happy hour there! \n\nThe interior is compact but interesting. It felt like I walked into an art gallery - paintings and other viewables adorned the walls and the soft lighting gave the place a homey feel. The men's bathroom was a trip! There was bottle sticking out of the wall (on purpose) and some funky wallpaper. The stall looked like an old, rusted trash bin but it was real cool! Almost made me want to ... errr uhhh ... never mind! \n\nThe best part about the place was the customer service! Our host Melody was probably the most welcoming host I've had at any restaurant! She really took pride in her job and the restaurant itself. I enjoyed talking with her - kind of felt I like I was talking to an old friend. I also had an opportunity to talk with the owner Sid Campbell - he was very gracious! I love restaurants with that mom-and-pop feel! \n\nAs for the food and cocktails, wifey started off with a \Low Tide\"" Pina Colada and I had the LB Signature \""Mojito\"" Lemonade. My bebida went down smoothly - not too strong, not watered-down. Wifey enjoyed her drink too. \n\nI ordered the Cajun Chicken Fettucine and my wife had the Fire Island pizza. Man, they served up some healthy portions! Unless you are REALLY hungry, you're probably going to be asking for a to-go box. \n\nMy dish was tasty - didn't need to put any salt or pepper on it. I was glad that it wasn't too spicy. My wife said her meal was very good - the cheesy was gooey and the dough was filling. I wouldn't say that we were \""blown away\"" by our entrees but we'll be back to sample other items on the menu. \n\nI have to admit that my bill was higher than I expected it to be but you'll always take a hit when you order cocktails at dinner. \n\nI'd definitely recommend this spot for anyone who's lookin' for a chill dining experience in downtown Phoenix.""",ysmq6lG8,1198

The dishes were full of flavor and you could really taste the herbs which were great. We enjoyed the thai tea and desserts. It was a first for both of us to try the bean desserts, super yummy.\n\nThe second time I went with my friends. We had an order of spring rolls and soup. Two of us got pho and the other friend had the spicy noodle soup. When my friend ordered the house special pho, the male server said \that's that combo, you don't want that, this one is better for you.\"" My friend asked what was the combo, and he didn't respond, just insisted she should change her order. Being confused she agreed with him. Regardless of the change, our food was delicious.\n\nSo why do I give it only 2 stars?\n\nTheir male server sucks. He never explains what he is doing, leaves you wondering what he went off to do when he leaves the table. The whole experience turns into a guessing game.\n\nOn the second visit with my friends, I had ordered two desserts, but had asked him to hold the order on one, until we were ready to leave, as I was going to take it to home, to my husband, as a treat. He brought both of them at the same time. Usually this isn't a huge deal, but it's a frozen drink, and when it melts, it loses it's taste and quality. I felt rushed to finish my drink and finish the outing with the girls, as I wanted to get the drink to my husband in decent condition.\n\nNext, I tried to use the yelp check-in discount, showed it to him prior to ordering, he said, ok, but when it came to paying, he wouldn't give me the discount. He kept on asking me to show him the discount, so I showed him that I checked in, he grabbed my phone, pushed some buttons, couldn't figure it out and walked away. My friends and I were just looking at each other, wondering if he was going to get a manager to help, he came back a few minutes later and asked if I had figured it out. To which I responded, I thought that's what you were doing. I was so frustrated by this point that I said forget it, just give us our check please. He rolled his eyes and came back with the checks.\n\nMy husband and I had the similar unpleasant experience with him the first visit. The ladies that work there are really nice, and honestly, they were the only reason I came back with my friends. I figured the male server was having an off day. I'm not sure that they have other servers, I wish they did.

I spent most of the last three years overseas, and when I was back visiting home, Marcellinos was always my top priority, and never disappointed me. \n\nEverything that they make is excellent, though I'm particularly attached and addicted to their thick, short, toothsome Pacatelli pasta with ragu di salsiccia , which is generously available at a discount for lunch. \n\n I don't know whether or not anyone can say that it is \perfect\"" pasta, but I would wager a lot that there is no pasta that is better. It is flawless. As close to the platonic ideal as we can get. \n\nThe same could probably be said of their tiramisu. \n\nUnfortunately it's not possible anymore to spend an afternoon drinking wine and espresso and smoking cigars on their patio, but that was only ever just icing on the cake.""",c3wb9T3U,1994

3531,2018-03-21 04:31:47,"LIVING PARASITE IN OUR FOOD - Manager did not care! - PICS INCLUDED\n\nI signed up to yelp just so I could write this single review about Donovan's chop house in Phoenix AZ.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e and I went out for a night of celebrating. \nA $250 meal is not uncommon for us, but usually with that type of price tag comes a certain level of service. Not at Donovan's Chop house in Phoenix.\n\nIt started when my fianc\u00e9e finished her oysters and noticed that something was in the oyster shell that she just ate from.\n\Is that moving?\"" she said?\n\""yes, yes it is\"" I replied.\n\nNot only was it moving, but it was alive.\n\nTurns out that a 'pea crab' was living inside of the oyster that my fianc\u00e9e just ate. We looked it up right then and there. According to google pea crabs are parasites that feed off of the oysters food supply.\nWhen I showed the server, she was stunned. She told me she would shot h chef.\nI asked her to show the manager too, and she said \""No, the chef will know what to do\"", as if I wanted the thing steamed and served with a side of butter.\n\nOur meal came, and when I asked about the pea crab, neither the expediter nor the bus boy, knew about our situation. It was only after I asked the server about what the chef said that the situation was acknowledged at all. \nIt was actually a full hour after finding the crab before the manager came over to drop off our check.\n\nShe never apologized and never once said that they would make changes and actually look for crabs in their oysters. She approached the entire situation with as much care as a short order cook that put mayonnaise on a burger by mistake.\n\nHow this disheveled woman got to me the manager of a high end chop house is beyond me. I have seen better managers at Dennys and Coco's bakery. At least there they check in on their customers.\nWhen I showed her the pics of the creature on my phone, she laughed and said these exact words \""Well, at least you have a fun story to tell\"".\nAnd she is absolutely correct. I tell everyone the story and it goes something like this:\n\nWe went to Donovan's Chop House in Phoenix and found a living parasite inside one of the oysters we just ate.  The manager waited a full hour before coming to our table and laughed off our experience as a \""fun story\"".  After being freaked out by finding a living creature in our food, the most she did for us was to knock $12 off of our $250 bill and did the bare minimum to make the situation right.\n\nGreat story huh Donovan's?\n\nHere are the pics:\n\nhttp://i1131.photobucket.com/albums/m545/collovamedia/IMG_20120204_201321.jpg\nhttp://i1131.photobucket.com/albums/m545/collovamedia/IMG_20120204_201207.jpg\nhttp://i1131.photobucket.com/albums/m545/collovamedia/IMG_20120204_201303.jpg\n\n\n\nThe rest of the food was goo,d, but not amazing.\nThe special of the day was a $68 pasta which was the best part of the meal.""",FoqKPL7S,350

Second drink cup is forgot after they ran out of the dispenser, after I remind him he gets a fresh stock of cups to replenish his dispenser but first takes his hand, fingers placed inside the cup and hand me one. Yuck.. Gf didn't catch it so I gave her the first cup and took the lingering finger taste cup as my own.\n\n\nFast forward a few minutes, guy is in there , his friends are loud and his face is cut wide open from who knows what incident.. He is arguing and finally his friends get him out the door. Now if I ran this place that guy and his yelling and problems would have been asked to stay, his hands Nd bloody shirt bumping and squeezing past people was discussing . But.. Let's let that go because it's busy and again this is MIll and it is 2 am..\n\n\n\nFast forward 10 minutes.. Tell the guy the ice machine is out, several minutes later.. They fill it.. Again it's busy, no big deal on that one, and with the high temp in the place maybe it killed on the fingerprint bacteria in my cup while we waited.. \I'm a wishful thinker\""\n\nSeveral more minutes go buy of people bustling past, smearing nastily cheese wish sandwich wrappers all o over the floor as We walked by \""place was trashed\"" I go back up and ask the guy for our order.. He said\"", oh sorry forgot\"" I was amused but it's just sliced pizza and a pretzel.. He tosses them in the oven, and a couple minutes later I get them. Well pizza had obviously been there forever but it was pizza, pretzel was hard as a rock and couldn't eat it.\n\n\nThen the show starts.. there had been a few people in there, that obviously knew the gentlemen working the register, the flooding actions are the cause for this reviewing of the above..\n\nShort list\n\n-employee is wiping his sweaty face by hand, receiving money..then is prepping pizza with topping BY BARE HAND.. Placing it in the oven, all with out gloves. This occurs over and over, then when his friends arrive there is a round of hand slaps... Um.. Where did these guys come from, did they wash their hands?, eww.  So in the 45 minutes I am in here,no hand washing, no gloves..his hands on food, toppings, money, hands, face, along with all over surfaces possible. Freaking DISGUSTING.\n\nBut it gets better.. His friends that he is conversing with are about to ice the cake..  One of them this red headed guy is reaching behind the counter near the pick up, and grabbing fries out of the Bin with his hands.. This happens no less than 10 times..\n\nAnother one ask his to meet them in the bathroom... Um what? Yes.. That locked bathroom father 1 am that is closed off to customers.. Hmm my imagination can only wonder what brief activity occurred in the restroom. could my dazed and non health conscious server and front man for this business also be doing drug's one can only speculate. His actions after reflected a very relaxed and dazed person.\n\nWhere I will give this guy a couple points, is end of the night he started picking up the place as it had slowed, well this obviously is his job and they have to clean up at the end of the night anyways..but was surprised at this point. \n\nAt this point and my food not eaten we are done being entertained by watching all this and he asked to take our plate at which time he noticed I didn't eat much. He asked if the pretzel was not good and I choose this time to politely tell him the reasons above as why we didn't finish. \n\nHe took it in stride, with no attitude but said simply they got busy and backed up. I do appreciate that but honestly there is ZERO excuse for even a small percentage of the actions to have taken place. I see this as a health risk and was more comfortable at taco stands in Mexico than this establishment. \n\n\n\nIn short, I'll be contacting the owner of this location. \n\nI do realize this is a late night food offering, I do realize the clientele, but I also know this is unacceptable and some poor guy who is mismanaging this place needs a wake up call.\n\n\nI will be back very soon, if anything just to see if changes are made after I voice my concerns. If needed ill be happy to forward my videos to the county health inspector.\n\n\n-Thanks for reading this little novel.""",mzDCgnDM,4138

Zen 32 was the closest one nearby and open after 8 p.m. on a Sunday, and en route to Blockbuster on the way back.  This was the first time both of us had been here.  They have a misted patio available to sit facing 32nd St., the sushi bar, or one of the dining tables.  In the back there is Zen Lounge for those who want to sit at the bar and eat with the T.V. going.\nWe were sat immediately at a booth/table and brought out waters by a busser.  While looking at the menu and drink list I noticed how dimly lit the place was and the music was some low playing repetitive Japanese flute music (better then house-trance I guess). One of the oriental dressed waitresses approached our table and gave us each a small cold cucumber salad and took our drink order.  A few minutes later she approached to see if we had questions or wanted to order a main dish.  We told her just sushi tonight and she leans in and picks up the menu we filled out and says, \well let me take a look at this to see if you've ordered correctly.\""  What?  My boyfriend and I just look at each other with an expression of 'there's a wrong way to order here?'  The order is repeated back to us and our apps. arrive soon after.  Good miso $4 and edemame $4, and we ordered spicy tuna roll $7, California roll $7, and shrimp roll $7.  Food was good but nothing mind blowing for their prices.

I could no longer resist the delicious smell of grilling that wafted out of the building.\n\nI ordered the Indulge cheddar burger, medium, and an order of the deep fried pickles, to go (as the restaurant was packed when I went in).\n\nThe burger was good quality and had a nice char flavor to it. The beef itself was tasty, and it was a perfect medium. The toppings were a bit lackluster; the cheddar cheese was good, but I would use a more sharp cheddar for something called a \cheddar burger\"". The red onion was good and crisp, but the tomato was a bit green, and the iceberg lettuce on it was fairly wilted and slimy. The bun for the burger was very good - butter-toasted it tasted like, and soft on the inside with a good crusty exterior.\n\nOn the whole, I probably would give this place 3.5 stars if I'd just ordered the burger. I can't say that it was a \""die-for\"" burger - overall for the price I would probably pick Five Guys over this any day, unless I was just really craving that charred flavor you can only get from a burger cooked on open flame.\n\nThe real disappointment in my book were the deep fried pickles. There are so few restaurants in town that serve them that I was happy to see that Indulge had them on the menu.They were listed as dill pickles, but they almost had an overtone of bread-and-butter - and while I know some people love them, to me B&B pickles taste like dirty socks. So to bite into what I expected to be a delicious, tart dill and instead wind up with a mouthful of smelly feet wasn't pleasant. I also thought the breading on the pickles was too thick, and almost overcooked (to the point of having a near-bitter burned taste).\n\nThe service - take-out only, obviously - was polite and made a point to stop by while I waited out front (the waiting room was standing-room only) to let me know when my order was about up.\n\nOverall I will probably give this place another shot sometime when I can dine in, and can splurge on trying the Kobe upgrade option for the burger. Otherwise, it was good food but probably not worth the $10 per sandwich on a regular basis.""",ESMmzYQe,915

3567,2018-03-13 23:47:07,"I'm really struggling with this review.  I wanted to really like this place, the concept is great, but in reality it just fell short.  \n\nOn a Friday night the place was practically empty.  It could have been the rain I guess but rain should never stop anyone!  Because it was empty conversation was easy and service was fairly attentive.  The atmosphere was similar to Cheuvront....huge windows, lots of light.  I don't think this would really make a good date place, however.  I would picture a chocolate and wine date in a dark place with plush couches you and sit on and have intimate conversation.  Sweet O just has tables and booths.  Nothing comfy and plush or intimate about it.\n\nThe wine selection is great, I will give them that.  Kudos for having more than one Pinot Grigio on the menu.  They have many flights to choose from and I went with the Italian Immigrants which was good.  (Although the pours in the flight were pretty meager.  The glass of wine that accompanied a friend's dessert, on the other hand, was a very generous pour.)  I wasn't terribly excited about the wines in the flight however, as they were all pretty similar in taste.  (Except for the one in the middle which had a mild smell of cheese.)  I ordered a champagne to have with dessert and it was so sweet I made a face, even though I ordered from the \dry\"" champagne list.  (I hate sweet champagne.)  \n\nThe food was just ok.  The paninis were nothing to write home about, I've had much better paninis in many other places.  I chose the Margarita panini, mozzarella, tomato and pesto, which was standard.  (And btw, it should really be Margherita, shouldn't it?  As in like an Italian pizza?  Not like a tequila infused Mexican drink?) The cheese plate that my friend and I shared was laughable.  Did you really put cheddar cheese on a cheese plate?  Like Cracker Barrel cheddar cheese?  For real?  The brie was awful and I can't remember what the other kind was, probably because the waitress herself didn't really explain it very well.  Definitely not like the (complimentary) cheese plate at Cheuvront.   My panini had some serious garlic in it so if you are going with a date bring some mints with you.\n\nSo I guess the point of the place isn't paninis or cheese.  (But you would expect that at any wine cafe....)  Its chocolate and dessert!  On my drive there I had been envisioning dessert so good that my husband I would make special trips out there on a night with no plans just to drink wine, eat dessert and stare blissfully into each other's eyes.  Well....I fully admit that I'm not a chocolate person but the non chocolate offerings were meager and my choice in coconut cake with passion fruit filling was more like passion fruit cake.  The chocolate offerings all seemed intensely rich (which was confirmed by other members of my party) and the chocolate flights, while looking yummy, are really meant for one.  So don't think you can share them easily as I watched two girls in my party try to split them up to share with interesting results.  \n\nThere was a point during the night when feeling a little nauseous at the table.  I think it may have been the insanely sweet champagne but I thought I was going to lose my dinner all over the place.  I didn't feel quite \""right\"" again until after I had gotten home and sipped some tea on my couch.  \n\nI really wanted to love this place.....but I just can't justify going out to Glendale just for it.  If the food and dessert had been good I totally could have.  But for a good wine selection there are a lot of other places closer to home that I would choose.  And its not really the type of place you'll go to before a sporting event.  \""Lets go have some chocolate and wine and then go and watch the Cardinals kick some ass!\""""",9The9KxA,2667

Service (from Kelly and James) was friendly and attentive.  \n\nWe took their recommendations and ordered the following:\n\n*Veggie Spring Rolls\n*Chilled Cucumber Salad\n*Soft Noodles (with Chicken and a fried egg)\n*Mushroom Purse\n*Shrimp in Lobster Sauce\n\nI know... that's a lot of food for two people, right?!\n\nWell, it sure was but we were hungry, and we did pretty well with it.  We polished off the spring rolls, cucumber salad, and mushroom purse and ended up taking home leftovers of the soft noodles and shrimp.  \n\nI really enjoyed the spring rolls and cucumber salad; I probably could've made a meal on those two menu items alone!  I also liked the mushroom purse - it includes all kinds of funky mushrooms prepared in what I think was a paper \""purse\"" of some sort.  I tasted ginger with the mushrooms, which is a good thing if you're like me and like ginger!  I love the concept of the soft noodles with a fried egg on top - everything is better with an egg on it!  This dish was lacking a bit of zing, but we added hot chile sauce to it and that did the trick.  The shrimp was tasty but similar to every other \""shrimp in lobster sauce\"" dish I've had in the past.\n\nThe one thing I'd like to see added to SMPP's menu is eggplant; I'm a huge eggplant fan and order it pretty much where ever I go! Regardless, even without eggplant, I'm really happy to have another Chinese option close to home.  \n\nSMPP is currently open for dinner six days a week (they are closed on Mondays).  They plan on opening for lunch in 2011.\n\nOh... and the point of me starting this review with my fortune? There was none; just wanted to share.  Feel free to share yours too!""",6ifWDmOn,2706

Unfortunately it has really gotten pretty bad in the last year or so. Its really sad to, we loved Mrs Whites but not anymore. \n    The last couple times we went the food was pretty sub par. The portions were much smaller and the quality and taste was rather poor. A couple of times ago we went with myself, my mother and my brother. I dont want this to sound racist but I feel it needs to said. I felt like we were definitely the wrong color to be eating there. \n   The service was ok but i noticed it was much better for the \locals\"" who were there at the same time. We ordered and sat and waited for our meal. I watched as some of the people around me were brought the same thing I had ordered and it looked fantastic. Nice big pieces of chicken with large portions of sides. \n    Well finally our food came and what a disappointment. Our portions were MUCH smaller then everyone elses and the sides were about half the size. My mother ordered catfish, (her favorite thing there) and it looked like it was half a filet. My smothered chicken was 2 very small wings and one small breast, (I had ordered all white meat) and there was very little gravy and cabbage. \n     I went ahead and tried Mrs Whites one last time a couple weeks ago and it was more of the same thing. I ordered the smothered chicken again and when it arrived I received 2 small wings and a back bone with no meat. The table right behind me had the same thing and received 2 large breasts and a nice sized wing. After attempting to eat the skin off the back bone I gave up and ate what little else there was on the plate. My mother did get a nice sized catfish filet but both our sides were very small. \n    I no longer recommend Mrs Whites. It looks like the kids have taken over running the place and I think thats the problem. The gentleman who was always in the kitchen did a wonderful job of making the place a great choice for fantastic food but i dont see him there much anymore. \n   Stay away from Mrs Whites unless you happen to be the right color.

Couple the fries with the savory dipping sauce and a cute presentation --the fries came out in a little metal shopping cart (everyone say \awe\"") --and I'll give the place a five star rating. \n\nSo, why the three star rating? Well, the place is just too small for its britches. The space is cramped. For the price I'm paying for the burger, I don't want to feel my elbows rubbing against a stranger sitting next to me. \n\nSpeaking of the burger. My husband ordered the Delux burger and proclaimed it one the best burgers he's had! \n\nI ordered a Chinese Chicken Salad and was surprised that the chicken looked and tasted like it was processed (not freshly grilled). It was a savory salad -- I just want fresh chicken on my salad - especially when I'm paying $12 bucks for a salad. \n\nAnother downside is that Delux is located in a strip mall. I think I would find the place more endearing if it were located, say, on Central Avenue as a standalone restaurant. Also, one other thing to note: The place seems to be frequented by a younger crowd (high school and college age kids driving up in their BMWs and Land Rovers). I'm not making judgements.

It's in a very small spot that shares a tiny shopping center with a Starbucks. There's virtually no parking, so if you go during a busy time, you're probably going to have to drive out and around, then park down the street. Also there is very little room for the lunch rush line, so everyone gets very uncomfortably close trying to stay inside so they're in the air conditioning.

3606,2018-04-13 22:14:19,"I've been to AMC Esplanade three times now - well, actually I should say TWO. We live about 35 minutes away from this theater so it is considered a \treat\"" to go wth our two kids, especially since it also costs us about $100 ($45 just for the tickets). Plus it's tough to find a PG movie we all want to see since our kids are 4 years apart - one is old enough for PG-13 but one is not...\n\nWhile the theater itself is clean and comfortable, BEWARE of how reservations are made at this place if you are using pre-paid tickets or gift cards!!!!! We have a regular AMC theater very close to us that we visit often, so we always have either gold/silver tickets or giftcards to use. And since it was just Christmas, we attempted to go see a PG family film at the dinner theater with brand new gift cards we received. I reserved 4 FRONT ROW seats in the middle section of the theater early Saturday afternoon and prepaid for them using my credit card on Fandango - the only way to reserve seats (PS - you'll pay a fee for this service, too, unless you have a Stubs membership). I knew from a previous trip that in order to use my gift cards, I just had to bring them with me and they would refund me in cash for the seats I paid for/reserved online. Works fine - IN THEORY!\n\nWe drove for 35 minutes and arrived about 10 minutes before show time with my gift cards and confirmation number for our reserved seats in hand. We stood in one of two lines and then watched the young girl at the counter pull up our reservation/seat map on a monitor facing out toward us. I told her I wanted to use my giftcards... No problem, she assured us... 10 seconds later, she points to the monitor and says we can have the last 4 seats in thes last two rows (two sets of two). I remind her that I already reserved 4 front row/middle section seats per my confirmation. Long story short, turns out that in order to use gift cards or prepaid tickts, AMC has to RELEASE your reserved seats, issue a refund, and then resell you back your seats. In the process, people without reservations in the line next to us walked right up and took our reserved-then-released-so-they-appeared-availabile seats. The  girl helping us said there was nothing she could do except put us in the last row.\n\nOf course I asked for a manager, who took about 5 minutes to get to us. He then not so politely told me we could have the seats in the back of the theater, but that was the best he could do, too. Even though we had reservations, he refused to tell the people who walked up that the seats they just picked (3 of our 4) had been reserved and that THEY had to move to the back seats. I argued for another minute with him, but by then it was too late - even if we split up and agreed to take the seats in the back row, they had been sold as well. The manager then tried to get us to go see another G-rated animated movie instead (no thanks).\n\nIn all fairness, the theater is comfortable and the food is OK (nothing fancy but nothing horrible - basic bar food), and it IS nice to be served during the movie. But we won't be going back. The manager did give us free tickets to return, but we won't use them there. I could have redeemed my giftcards for the food had I known there was a chance we'd lose our reserved seats - something that AMC could have recommended we do (or at least warn us that we could potentially lose them)!. Our entire family was beyond disappointed and I thought the way the entire issue was handled was just awful. A Harkins theater is just as close to us as AMC in our little town, so my next gift card request and prepaid ticket purchases will be for Harkins instead. Such a shame that such a cool concept is so pooly managed.""",bB3TMMKn,4664

3634,2018-01-21 18:56:09,"I've waited some time to write this review, to ensure I could be as unbiased as possible given my awful dealings with this company.\n\nI hired Flooring 2 Day on three occasions.  The first and second went off rather smoothly, as they just tiled two small bathrooms for me.  The tile that came the second time was not identical to the tile I chose (I have a very good memory when it comes to colors and palettes), but I liked it enough that when the subcontractor showed up with it, I had him put it in anyhow.\n\nThe third occasion went as follows:\n\n1.) Called the business and scheduled an in home appointment.  The salesperson Brian, who is very personable, came and showed me samples of wood flooring and some other options.  I was not pleased with the selection as I had something in particular in mind.  I had to also be sure to get something low emissions since my daughter has asthma.  He said he had another product he wanted to show me, so he came back another day and showed it to me.  It was Wood Look Tile Plank Flooring.\n\n2.) I called the office to order the flooring after doing some research and price comparisons.  Adam in the office told me I needed to pay 100% upfront.  This should have been a red flag.  What flooring company requests 100% upfront?  I was not comfortable with this and I told him I'd always paid 50% upfront in the past.  Adam said \you said you chose us because you trust us,\"" to which I responded \""the only people I trust completely are my family members.\""  After some negotiation, we agreed on 50% upfront, 25% when the materials were delivered and 25% upon completion of the job.  \n\n3.) On 2/3/12 I signed a contract and paid my 50% deposit with a credit card access check for a job to start 2/6/12.\n\n4.) On 2/7/12 the subcontractor showed up and started removing the carpet in the living room.  He said he had to go get the tile.  He went to get the tile and it was NOT the same as what I'd purchased. *ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF MY FLOORING WAS REMOVED*\n\n5.) I called Adam in the office and he said he would be by in 20 minutes with the original sample, which he was getting from Brian, so we could compare it to the tile that was at the house.\n\n6.) Adam never showed up.  Instead, after calling him and getting a hold of him hours later, he said he was looking for something closer to what we ordered.  \n\n7.) My husband called and asked Adam who the manufacturer of the tile was that he was supplying.  He refused, saying it was proprietary information.  This was not acceptable to us because we needed to know this information for warranty and recall issues that may arise.\n\n8.) We sent a certified letter to cancel the tile on 2/8/12 after seeing the second set of tile which looked identical to the first tile that was sent over.\n\n9.) After not hearing back from the business, we contracted an attorney who sent several certified letters with no response.\n\n10.) We filed an ROC complaint through our attorney in order to try to get a response from the company.  The company did respond, by having the office manager call to yell and hang up on our attorney's office staff.\n\n11.) After months of trying to contact the business, we never received a response.  Our bank was not able to contact the business for their response, either, so they refunded our deposit in good faith after a few months.\n\n12.) The bank is now burdened with the collections efforts instead of us.  Word of advice: Always pay with a credit card and not an access check or personal check.  A bank can yank the funds back from a credit card transaction, but not a check.\n\nStill no response from Flooring 2 Day, but before the complaint I just filed with the BBB moments ago, I found that their rating has decreased from an A+ to a B in the last couple months.  I guess others are having problems, as well.\n\nMoral of the story, if you see red flags with a business... trust your gut.  I didn't, and I spent a lot of time, effort and inconvenience dealing with the issue as a result.\n\nUPDATE 7/3/12 - The business rating has decreased to an F.  See photo.\n\nUPDATE: 7/12/12 - I received a response from Flooring 2 Day from the BBB wherein they actually fabricated a story saying I jumped in my vehicle when the crew arrived to do work and drove away!  Additionally, they say they removed all my carpet and tile and prepared the floor to do work on 2/7, which just didn't happen.  They only removed a small portion of one room of my flooring... and left the place in disarray.""",NJk77CaN,1284
3635,2018-03-30 04:01:45,"Very nice little Japanese restaurant.\n\nWe've been once for lunch and once for dinner.\n\nI love the fact that they cut a thick slab of fish for the sushi and sashimi here, much more so than other Japanese places I've been in Arizona.  This is true Japanese style and how sushi is supposed to be served.  \n\nWe recently visited another \high-end\"" Japanese restaurant in Scottsdale which served the smallest pieces of fish I've ever seen in a restaurant at exorbitant prices. Ridiculous.  Well, that's not what is going on here. \n\nI don't know how or why Japanese restaurants have evolved in the USA into serving super-expensive micro-portions but that ain't how it is in Japan.  Sushi is supposed to be quick and easy comfort food.  A sushi joint in Japan is filled with normal working people chowing down on massive portions of fish, served quickly and without ostentation, not boob-jobbed bulemics eating over-priced, razor thin slices of fish.  Even today, in Tokyo you can get 10 orders of nigiri for less than $20.  Sakana fits nicely into that unpretentious tradition.\n\nAt Sakana, the quality of the fish is high.  The menu is not very broad and they don't have a huge selection but what they do have is fresh and excellent.  It is also an excellent value, particularly at lunch where $9.95 buys you a very ample sushi combination.\n\nService is quick and friendly.  Recommended.""",YGOFeH8j,455

I remember the first time we went after hearing about it here on Yelp, we ended up leaving with the 'ole \where have you been my whole life\"" feeling. This place is awesome. \n    The Cornish Pasty is located on the side of a very random and small strip mall, if you didn't know you were looking for it you would probably not even notice it. It is small on the inside, a narrow straight corridor with, I believe, nine table, most of them two seaters, and while it has no big budget decorations, it is completely inviting and welcoming. It just feels right inside, a combination of old mining photos and 1940's country, a bare floor and a huge bar with completely open kitchen area to chat with the cooks while imbibing. We have consistently had great service when eating here, the waiters and waitresses are always very friendly and talkative, it's a fun place to be. \nThe food is top notch and super cheap, you can leave totally full and pay less than ten bucks, incredible. We have probably been here a couple dozen times and I have tried a large majority of the menu and have not found a pasty I didn't enjoy yet. Kristen's favorites are the Italian, which is pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, basil and tomatoes with a marinara dipping sauce and the Pilgrim, which is turkey, sweet potatoes, grilled onions, stuffing and a red wine gravy, and I can attest, they are both delicious. My favorites are the Mexican, which is spiced steak strips, potatoes, eggs, hatch chilies and cheddar with a side of sour cream and the Shepard's Pie, which is lamb, peas, carrots, grilled onions, mashed potatoes and cheddar with a side of gravy, these are both like heaven in your mouth. And if you enjoy the occasional beer, Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar is my favorite and they have it on tap, they actually have a pretty good selection of brews. \n    If you have not tried the Cornish Pasty Company yet, you are doing yourself a great disservice, you can stop by today and get a cold beer a warm pasty and a full stomach for well under twenty bucks.

The waitress responded with \oh, basically a skinny rita? Sure\"".  The other three of us ordered Skinny-ritas as well and a conversation before the drinks arrived braced us for disappointment - we all thought we would get four regular skinny ritas.

3648,2018-05-11 20:07:57,"Pho Avina is \OK\"" at best. It is hard to give an accurate rating using a five star system. This place would rate a five on a scale from one to ten. \n\nHowever, I'm not going to be too harsh just based on the principle that there aren't many options with ethnic foods in AZ so they earn a three for that alone. \n\nI can't say the food isn't terrible, because it isn't, but it is definitely sub par from the Vietnamese that I am used to. I tried the rolls, pho and rice dishes from Avina.  \n\nAvina's fresh rolls were small, and as mentioned oddly sweet. The hoisin and peanut (that's \""seafood\"" for those of you who can't speak 10 languages like me) sauce was also a strange pastel color rather than the dark purplish brown that it naturally comes in. Odd. \n\nTheir fried rolls were also very plain. It was just pork in there. Not very Vietnamese/SE Asian if you ask me. What happened to pork, \""wood mushroom\"" (I have no idea what the fuck it's called in English believe it or not), carrots, and \""phun see\""?  \n\nPho is, for lack of a better term, the bread and butter of a Vietnamese place. Avina's pho was scant on meat, and the broth as noted by another commenter was oddly sweet (as a matter of fact, everything there that isn't supposed to be sweet was very sweet). \n\nAnother deal is this, every Vietnamese restaurant I've been to gives you size options when ordering pho. Size small for lame asses and size large for people like me who want to eat a big ass bowl of pho with flank steak, tripe, tendon, fatty flank, and meatballs; real talk. The herb plate that accompanied Avina's pho bowl was also on the scant side but I guess since the noodle bowl is small you don't need so many herbs and jalapenos to throw in there do you. Guess not. \n\nThe rice dish I tried was also a let down. Not on taste (other than the sweetness) mind you, but again, every rice dish I'm used to comes standard with a slab of egg cake and a small portion of a ground up pork, tripe, and peanut mixture, along with your pickled carrots, turnips, and cucumbers. The rice dish from Avina came with two cucumber slices, and a couple (and I do mean a couple) of other pickled vegetables. The pork chop was also small as hell. Weak. \n\nAsian food (aside from sushi houses) isn't known for serving small portions! \n\nTo sum it up, Avina is pricey for the kind of food that it is, has small portions, and everything is oddly sweet. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm just spoiled from how it's done on the east coast.""",F5PJzkC3,2858

3677,2018-03-06 04:08:14,"Do not be swayed by the dingy office park that this place is located in or the fact that it looks like a redecorated Ponderosa Steak House.  This place was the ONLY place in the valley that could meet my stringent 4-point criteria for fajita perfection.\n\n1) Tortillas must be freshly made in house and of the thick and chewy variety.  CHECK!  As much as I love me a paper thin authentic tortilla to sop up posole or machaca, when it comes to fajitas, I need what I have now learned are sometimes dubbed Texas tortillas that are pillowy, warm and slightly chewy.  Fajitas makes them with skill.  Love.\n\n2) The chicken or steak should be grilled, preferably over mesquite.  CHECK!  Charred goodness awaits you, and those guys behind the grill are masters of their craft.\n\n3) Steak should be able to be ordered medium rare or rare.  CHECK!  Although you can't specify the temperature of the meat, if you order the Cadillac Fajitas made of beef tenderloin, they come out blissfully mooing in the center.  Heaven.\n\n4) Vegetables should be limited to peppers and onions.  No broccoli, mushrooms, squash, whatever, unless you are ordering vegetarian fajitas.  CHECK!  Ok, I know this is nitpicky, but I don't want my meat, pepper and onion experience to be sullied with broccoli.\n\nAdditionally, if you like shrimp, ORDER THE SHRIMP FAJITAS.  I don't know what they marinate them in or how they cook them, but those babies are like crack.  Pure, unadulterated crack.  Other bonuses - the portions are huge without sacrificing quality, making the whole experience a killer value.  You literally get a raft of guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream and cheese to top your fajitas, making a half pound portion plenty to share.  Or don't share and take home the leftovers.  Chips and salsa are yummy, taking up far too much fajita space in your stomach before you eat, the yellow rice is fluffy and delicious, and though the beans are forgettable, the margarita is potent enough to keep you happy regardless.\n\nWe found this place in a moment of frustration at the fact that we couldn't locate the perfect fajitas in the Valley.  So what do we do?  We Yelp \best fajitas in phoenix\"" and get (duh!) a restaurant called Fajitas.  If it were a snake, it would've bit us.  We still make the trip to Glendale just to feast at this place and swear to play a round of putt-putt at Castles and Coasters afterwards to walk off the excessive fullness.

Sucks to be a chocolate fan! \n\nI looked at my friend and we silently eyed the door; I couldn't bring myself to purchase food from such an unkempt establishment.

3682,2018-05-04 09:58:23,"I totally understand both the 5 * and 1* ratings on this place.  We LOVED it and had an amazing stay but really, don't look too deeply beneath the surface.  The Clarendon is really the type of place you have to give yourself over to.  The rooms are cheaply decorated- though big new flatscreens (ours was hilariously hung so crookedly that I'd swear I might have put it up there myself, we're talking 45 degrees off center and bolted to the wall that way) and there isn't enough lighting and it looks like my  kid painted the room- or that they paid the painter in Tequila.  All sucky things when you've reached that age and socio-economic status where you could actually afford a $200/night room.  BUT...this place had personality galore.  It is white trash all the way and if you just go with it you will see it through rose-colored glasses.  Here's the rundown:\n\n-- Location:  in a crappy area surrounded by more crappy area.  Not near the freeway but only 15 minutes or so from the airport.\n\n--Room decor:  already mentioned\n\n++Pool:  The pool area was awesome. They have a wall-of-water waterfall on one side that is cool to look at.  The tiling and layout of the pool are really unique and it has the largest hot tub I've ever seen at a hotel.  From the people watching we surmised it was a rockabilly, gay friendly hotel.  The only downner was that the hotel rooms block the sun after 3:00.\n\n+/-Bar:  Seemed very pricey to me but they had a GREAT homemade white sangria and were very friendly.\n\n++ Restaurant:  This actually was hit or miss but the hits were so f*ing delicious that we all agreed the place was fantastic. So much so that we ate there our second night rather than go to a new restaurant in the city.  The guacamole was a big MISS for us. They make it with, I think, mango. It is freshly made but has a yucky fruity flavor.  But the carne asada tacos and roasted 1/2 chicken were TO DIE FOR!!  The most deliciously flavored meats ever.  OMG.  I'm not kidding.\n\n+/- \Resort\"" fee:  Having actually stayed in the $200 hotels I'm used to this b.s. fee and felt fine with it since at more expensive hotels the fee doesn't seem to pay for a damn thing- internet is still more, minibar snacks still cost, etc.  At least with this fee, we got internet and pillaged the front desk for snacks each night.  There is the - that the \""free\"" snacks included in your resort fee are only available from 10p.m. until 7 a.m. but whatever.  \n\n+/- Fitness Room:  Well, they had one but it was barren and had very old equipment.  That said, everything they did have, did work....\n\nAll in all we had a great time. Would definitely go back.  \n\nOne last thing- this is not a Family Hotel.  It would be most enjoyed by those under 50 wo understand and appreciate kitsch.\n\nI did want to disclose that we stayed as part of a GROUP-ON deal and paid only $49/night.  YES- $49/night.  It was the best $49 ever! :)""",pI5sr0W0,3620

3685,2018-05-31 17:40:24,"When I planned our visit to Phoenix and decided to eat Italian food one night while we were there, I envisioned one of those old style southern Italian neighborhood eateries that I remembered, and so often enjoyed, growing up in New York city (many years ago). Turning to Yelp reviewers and after reading Riazzi's accolades, I was sure I'd found a real winner. When I saw that Riazzi's promoted the fact that they've been around since 1947, I was doubly confident that I'd found exactly what I was looking for. Not so. Maybe it was that 50 years ago, but no longer. \n\nCocktails were the best part of the meal. \n\nFrom that point, everything went down hill. Bread was soft and spongy, not the crusty chewy loaf I expected. Butter was soft and in a tiny prepackaged tub. The quality of the antipasto ingredients although plentiful, tasted like they came directly from a super market salad bar; breaded and fried calamari was overly bready and strangely mushy; two of the salads were over dressed, and one barely moistened, with a watery overly vinegary house Italian dressing. \n\nFor our main courses we chose; chicken parmigiana which was deemed \not as good as Olive Garden\""; Shrimp parmigiana (4 medium sized shrimp smothered in tomato sauce and mozzarella for $17.95); baked sea scallops which were overly breaded and tasted of some indistinguishable and unpleasant spice or herb; and traditional lasagna. Our collective conclusion was that the least offensive choice was the latter, although it was skimpy with meat and unnecessarily abundant with cheese. \n\nAll entrees included the aforementioned salads and (except for the lasagna) a side of overcooked pasta. Red sauce on the pasta was edible, but the Alfredo congealed into one sticky like warm mass. \n\nDon't bother with this place unless you have a time machine and set it back half a century.""",BcmduAcr,3710

Menu says it is served with their \""delicious beer bread.\"" Not sure what \""beer bread\"" is but unless its tortilla chips or pita bread, it was absent.

It had an ice cream scoop size of sour cream blotted into the small soup cup. Also stupid from a food cost perspective.  \n\nWhen the bartender cleared the plates, she failed to ask how everything was. She picked up my wife's plate, looked at the uneaten food, shrugged her shoulders & threw it out. Never asked if we wanted to bring it home either. Just threw it out. Still on the bill.\n\nI still wanted to have another beer. My wife said, \""NO WAY, I'm not sitting her one more second with this crappy service. This chick sucks & I can't take it anymore\"" How do you argue with that? So we left. We'll never be back either. \n\nA lot of waiting, pulling teeth for any kind of service & a general feeling of being uncomfortable. Great place with awesome potential, but they really shoot themselves in the foot.""",ucSK9iNS,2768

We were happy and frequent customers of the Walnut Creek location.  We moved away from CA about ten years ago and were sad to hear some years later that Oakville Grocery in Walnut Creek had closed.  Surprised too since it was always quite busy.\n\nSo when we were planning a visit to Scottsdale and a friend who lives here invited us to a Superbowl party with the request we bring an appetizer and a bottle of wine, we searched Yelp for specialty take out options and were happy to learn of the new Oakville Grocery in Scottsdale just a couple of miles from the resort where we're staying!\n\nYahoo!  Walking in the door of this store brought back many great food memories.  Shopping at this store on two consecutive days created new memories of great food.  \n\nThe first day we picked up delicious cerignola olives, wonderful sauteed broccolini and wild mushroom lasagne from the prepared foods section and a carton of banana gelato from the freezer case for dinner back at our villa unit after a long day's drive from Las Vegas.  It was perfect.\n\nWe also placed an order for arancini and some fresh made mozzarella to pick up the following day to take to the party.  We returned the second day to pick up the order and while we waited on it to be packed up we enjoyed a lunchtime bowl of yummy, tomatoey, just right for chili heat tortilla soup from the sandwich / soup / pizza counter at the back of the store.  \n\nWe used the mozzarella in a caprese salad and it was delicious.  We have to say that having consumed many arancini at the other Oakville locations (and many, many more in other venues) we didn't find these to be the best we've ever had, but good enough.  \n\nThe counter staff were all so helpful.  The aisles of specialty items were well stocked with all the things that make Oakville Grocery \""the place to find 'it'\"". And as for the cheese case...there is not a retailer we can think of who does cheese was well as Oakville.  Wonderful.\n\nLots of seating too, both inside and out, to sit and enjoy a nosh.  Since the coffee service window opens for coffee and goodies a couple of hours ahead of the store itself, it's a fun way to start the day sitting at the outdoor tables.\n\nThe only drawback here is parking at this location is awful.  Just a few parking spots out front, it seems, or one has to use the garage across the street.  The limited parking could be a negative for Oakville's business when parking is so convenient at a local Whole Foods market that provides some pretty good analogs for the Oakville specialties.

3749,2018-02-17 15:54:00,"I love good food, this includes pizza, and I find that I'm a pizza/food agnostic/nazi. Chicago deep dish \pie\"" style, crispy new york style... theres something good in all of them. Rustic or high tech, I enjoy it all. I just cant stand thoughless preparation of meals, that would be the \""Hard liner\"" in me.\nNot to worry, Grimaldi's delivers in every way that matters!\nFrom entering on a Sunday evening, everyone was honestly warm in their greeting, chatting about the day etc. \nFrom the tea which was perfect (Mine basic non-sweetened, and The Brides Passion fruit wonderfulness, both were simple, basic and perfect for the meal)\nBoth of us were expecting leftovers, so we opted for a small salad each, knowing that the portions were huge, I just wanted a Greek style salad, while the Bride had zero desire for feta/olives etc so opted for a house salad. So two small *SNORT SMALL!* salads were brought to out table... sheesh! Not so much small as only a buffet on a plate! \nMy Medeteranion salad was very good, I admit it was blander than I like, Lots of feta, (YAY) however I had asked for extra, and they sure delivered! Strangely enough, the feta was blander than I'm used to, which caught me by surprise. Still creamy and tart, very welcome indeed. \nAlso, No onions on the salad? I'm sure it was an over site, next time I'll ask for extra onions, (a silly for onions!) \nOr a different salad, I tried The Brides house salad and the flavor's were a wonderful balance, the roasted peppers really added a lot of flavors.. smoky/sweet, just wonderfully clean and fresh.\nOn\n\n\nAnd then.. to the pizza.\nSo pretty! It's so rare that you look at a \""lowly\"" pizza and see the level of care that went into its construction.\nWe opted for a classic first time benchmark. Pepperoni, sausage, onions with fresh garlic.\nI usually avoid garlic, but The Bride wanted it, and since it was fresh and not garlic powder, I was open to it. The garlic was quite good, however it wasn't really needed on the pie.The fresh basil, which tasted fresh from the garden, was lovely, and I would order more of that instead of garlic next time. (and possibly meatballs).\nThe crust was this with a good chew. Mozzarella cheese was fresh and NOTHING like the shredded crap you can get at Costco etc. \nYou can tell the placing of the toppings was done with care, evenly dispensed, but not uniform,  It was without a doubt the best sausage I've had in decades. And the pepperoni was flavorful, although the thick cut did make the texture a tad different, I'm told it was a slicer issue, and not the usual preparation method.   \nWe had a great chat with our server about the restaurant and how it's been going over, also Jennifer who seems to be a manager came over and chatted for a bit, very nice, laid back and fun. \n\nIf your in a hurry, and planning a eary dinner, late lunch, I recommend calling first, since the charcoal over requires cheaning once during the day, and it's unable to cook for around a hour or so, so you might want to avoid that period.\nAlso, as a earlier Yelper commented they do not use gloves when making crust, as someone who was a cook in my youth I'm amazed, I mean, making a pizza with rubber gloves? Talk about overkill, and a pain in the rear! Your trusting them to touch your food in other ways, i don't see the issue. Also, the oven gets to 1000% so I'm not worried about anything nasty making it out of there, if anything, I don't want the flavor of melted plastic on my Za! (and I'm not such a germaphobe that I fear chefs touching my food, if I wanted a conveyor belt style meal.. no shortage of options around here.\n\n\nPro: Great, classic New York pizza, epic portions, extraordinary pride taken in providing a premium product. with quick, efficient, good natured, prideful service. Passion fruit tea was the best I've ever had. \nAnd We were informed by Jennifer (a manager of some sort i gather) that you can order your pizza like a steak. rare, medium rare, medium, medium well, well done.... all giving different levels of crunch to the dough and toppings etc. \nNext time we are going to try playing with that aspect... perhaps some extra cheese and go medium or medium well? Get a tad more of the charcoal crustiness to it. \nCon: Limited menu, I know, that a place like this would make a killer meatball & Spagetti, or sandwich! I appreciate the total focus on making the perfect pie... but when the farthest afield they go is a Calzone .. well they are almost rainman level focused! (take it  thats a complement, I'm just greedy, I admit it.\nThe meditiranian salad was blander than expected. They use the same dressing for this salad as for the house salad. Yes, feta helps, but some peperoncini and Greek dressing, would be nice. Next time, I'll either try the Cesare or antipasto, or skip that course. (And a little bread, just pizza dough with s with the salad would be nice).\nGimmick or not, the water tastes great! Almost worth not getting a drink and enjoying the delicious aqua!""",1rUtBiUq,283

Oh my oh my I long for Friday's 11-2pm ish.  I order Fish Taco's on many a menu and these rank in my top 3 of all time. 2 tacos, Special sweet sauce (lots), hot homemade tacos, crunch cabbage...FINGER LICKIN good.  $8.95 I think. It comes with a salad that I barely touched because it couldn't keep up with the tastebud party of the fish tacos. They should swap out the salad for something else more exciting like a summer corn veggie \salad\"" or something.  \n\nAnyway, my other MUST HAVE at The Coffee Shop is the scones!

The bar was really cool looking and we loved the idea of using green apples as paperweights. The selection of wine and beer was really decent for a place with a limited menu. The bartender, however, poured us pathetically small glasses of wine. It would have been ok if it appeared to be consistent, but we saw several glasses going out to tables that were much fuller. They weren't exorbitantly priced glasses, but I still want what I'm paying for!\n  Next, the food. The zucchini fries were bland and fell apart, but the sauce that they came with was pretty tasty. The truffle fries were lacking in a good truffle flavor. Some of the fries in the basket were soggy and some were burnt. We sent most of them back. The veggie burger was super good. Just about one of the best veggie burgers I've ever tasted, surprisingly. The report from the ahi burger was \ok\"". The report from the Zinburger was \""ok and undercooked according to my order\"". The sweet potato fries were delicious. \n  The service was good. Elizabeth busted her butt to get us everything we needed, despite the clear lack of organization in the rest of the restaurant: The place had cleared out considerably by the time we ordered, and it still took about 30 minutes to get our food!\n  As with most Fox Concepts, it's all concept and no substance.

Yay! :-)\n\nThere wasn't anything that stuck out to me on the menu. For the food portion, I decided to order a simple seafood cobb salad.  Can't go wrong with that.  At first I thought that $14 for a salad is a bit over priced, but man, th portion was huge.  A huge bowl was placed before me and I started to chow down.  The fresh real crab and baby shrimp scattered throughout the salad and added a nice twist to the traditional cobb salad.  The ingredients were fresh and the lettuce was crisp.  I would have liked it better if there was more seafood in the dish.  A vinaigreete works beautifully with cobb salads.  With 4 different different housemade vinaigrettes to choose from, they all seemed great to compliment the salads.  I tried to the Marzen balsamic vinaigrette by the recommendation of the server.  It has the tangy balsamic taste, but not overwhelming to mask the light flavors of the seafood in the salad.\n\nAn average score for pretty good service, but so-so selection and food taste.""",rQR6yUTf,2242

3802,2018-01-23 07:03:05,"This would probably be a five-star review if I came for happy hour, but coming here for dinner was a solid experience nonetheless. \n\nMy uncle was staying at the Valley Ho so my mom, sister, and I met him for dinner here. The place was pretty empty on an early Saturday night, but I really liked the swanky, retro atmosphere. \n\nThe menu looked pretty good all the way around, but what really stood out to me was the number of salad options and the \small plates\"" that were offered. There was about ten different salad options, and although none of them seemed completely crazy, original they all sounded delicious. One of those with a small plate (there's about 12-15 different options there) makes for a great meal. \n\nI went with a Cesar salad (I know, boring), but it was delicious. It was a little heavy on the dressing, but the croutons were to die for . I went with the lamb sausage small plate which came with a tangy cucumber salad, which was delicious as well. With the Cesar salad this was the perfect amount of food. My uncle (who can be a pain to dine with) had the salmon, which he really liked (he was very skeptical about eating salmon in AZ). My parents come here often and my dad (who wasn't with us this time around) says the beef stroganoff is the best he's ever had, and that's pretty big coming from him. \n\nThe service here is good (although like I said the place was pretty empty during my experience) and the prices are adequate for the portions and quality of the food. When I'm back in AZ visiting the fam, I'll be back! I NEED to come here for happy hour!!!""",Nv6IBgjv,3059

(Not really asking for an opinion here, but ok, thanks anyway)\nSo then, I ordered the pasta with marinara and added mushrooms (waiter said, why do you have the change the menu, you are such a woman. Ummm..ok, again, didn't ask for your opinion, but ok, thanks)\n\nPasta was fresh and pretty good, better with mushrooms, i suggested they change the menu being the \woman\"" that I am. \n\nThe salad was mediocre at best, just lettuce and one tomato. would like to see more additions here. \n\nThis restaurant serves FOUR veal dishes, I am strongly opposed to any restaurant killing and eating 6 week old baby cows, so I won't be returning here. They have NO vegan options other than the salad, rare for an italian place. I would highly suggest adding more vegan options and doing away with the veal options, it would open your restaurant up to all new clientele.

3820,2018-04-16 10:04:10,"I have passed by Yen Sushi & Sake Bar several times over the past couple of years always promising myself that I would venture inside and try the place out. However, I never made the leap - until last weekend. My daughter and her fiance raved about Paul, the sushi chef/owner of Yen and told me if I didn't go check it out I would be doing myself a severe disservice. \n\nSince my very dear friend SLR and I had not seen in each other for some time and were ardent sushi fans, I suggested she schlep up to my part of town and meet me at Yen for dinner. Besides....I was paying. When I arrived at the restaurant after an aerobic shopping session, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that Paul, the owner, was no other than the Paul I knew from the sushi bar at Takamatsu (a Korean restaurant at 43rd Ave. & Olive).\n\nPaul remembered me and asked about my kids. I told him that my older daughter advised me to come in and now I was especially looking forward to a culinary work-out because Paul is nothing short of amazing. SLR and I arrived at the restaurant at 5pm and didn't leave until 8pm. We enjoyed the dinner, drinks, and company. We never felt rushed or made to feel that we were \holding up the wheels of progress\"" by hanging out for so long.\n\nNot only do I enjoy trying out the standard sushi fare at every restaurant (I'm a dyed-in-the-wool spicy scallop nigiri fan) but also adventurous enough to sample specialties of the house. We ordered the Rainbow Roll, a Caterpillar Roll, some nigiri sushi, and the piece de resistance:  the Palm Springs Roll which is a crab roll covered in a not-too-rich but just-right creamy sauce and small, delicately cut pieces of TOMATOES! I have never seen this particular dish offered at any other sushi venue so I have nothing against which to compare it. I will say, however, that it was FANTASTIC.\n\nThe prices at Yen Sushi and Sake Bar are below average but the food is so far above average that I don't have room enough in this review to expound on the details.

Ah what treasures lie hidden in a strip mall....\n\nWe were greeted by a friendly young man who took our order right away, I ordered, well I don't quite remember the name,  but it was steak pieces with french fries and onions, and rice.  I was fooled by the mild salsa that came with the chips and said, \hey can you make my dish spicy?\""  The server said no problem, and while the dish was very fresh, my mouth was on fire, and I touched  my eye and it was like pepper spray or something.  I love hot food, I can eat Los Dos Molinos Abogado ribs for example with little problem, but this stuff kicked my butt!!  It had little red peppers in it that I have never experienced before. HOT!!  I kept remembering Deb's review:\""....this is not Mexican food....\"".  No kidding, next time I will get it milder.  My eye burns still.....\n\nWife got a milder flat pan steak dish with lentils and rice.  She praised its freshness.  We also split a red beef tamale (they were only like $2) so it was just a sample but decent.\n\nThey only have 6 tables in there!  And they had to change their name due to copyright infringement from a restaurant  in Texas according to the young man.  Either way, we will be back for sure.  Good stuff!!  Something tells me there is more burn to come, perhaps tomorrow if you know what I mean?  Beware!  They can really spice it up if you ask them too.  I met my match at Mi Comida....\n\nFresh ingredients, nice people, and a nice change from Mexican food.\n\nRecommended!  Don't touch your eyes if you touched those little red pepper things, that is for sure!!""",3YORZugm,4539

I'd heard of the Herb Box and read some good reviews so we decided to try it.

Goes to show you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover.\n\nWe both ordered sandwiches which come with some of the best sweet potato chips I've ever had. My sandwich was a chicken, pesto, goat cheese combo that was out of this world.

3852,2018-05-10 03:38:02,This place is Super Sketch.  They have a younger looking manager that is a total prick and thinks he is god's gift to mankind.  He is a total creeper that flirts with and is nice to attractive females only.  If you look at the positive reviews for this place it is all females.  I brought my car here a few times only because I was lazy and it was close to where I lived at the time.  The last straw was when I brought in my car for a simple oil change and they do the usual thing where they call me and tell me my car is going to explode if I don't get another $500 dollars worth of work.  What made this call different is I declined the upsale as usual but when I showed up I learned he took it upon himself to give my car almost $400 worth of work.  The creeper manager was gone and the person I was dealing with was just doing his job so I maintained my composure instead of having a catergory 5 meltdown.  I switched to Advanced Auto on McDowell and it is MUCH better.  I have seen cops there the last two times I have drove by so I don't what the hell is going on.,lIswaSey,4831

I'm not sure what happened this year. \n\nWe pre-purchased our tickets this year for general admission and for the beer garden - I love craft beer - in order to save a little money.  We showed up as usual ready to spend some money (it does get pricey) and sample some great food.  There were maybe half the usual number of vendors there this year.  The same went for the beer garden.  \n\nWe still had a good time and sampled some good food.  There are usually decent bands to listen to also.  I will definitely double check the vendor list next year before we head up there.

I'm a coffee snob. \nAfter beginning a Starbucks Boycott last year (they used powdered coffee in just about everything other than their brewed coffee) I was starting to get lonely. \nOn our way to Matt's Big Breakfast, my mother and I pulled in to Dutch Bros so I could try it out.

It's like crack in a cup - in a good way.\nI've since waned from my usal 4DT, but you know what I like about Dutch Bros, even more than the coffee? The service. I do not mind paying a little extra when I get treated the way I do at Dutch Bros. They ask you how you're doing, what you're up to, and they remember what you tell them so next time they ask, \How'd you do on your Forensic exam?\"" It makes you feel better! \nOh, and they have a (drum roll please)... A PUNCH CARD THINGIE! \nFor every ten coffees you buy (no matter the size) you get a little neat-o stamp on your card and after the ten, you get one (whatever size) FOR FREE!!!!!! FREE!!! FREE!!!! There are so many size restrictions on punch cards that I nearly squealed when I realized that I didn't have to pay extra for my large iced ER 911. I'm a college student. \""Free\"" is my favorite word.\n\nSo go, my brothers and sisters! Go and have coffee that will make your morning caffeinated! Go and be treated wonderfully rather than crappily at your local Starbucks that you pay for powdered coffee! Go and get your real, roasted-bean goodness in a cute cup that has flowers on it!

Our server was nice enough, but I got the feeling from her that waiting on a group of 6 women was not her idea of a fun night.  Tuesday nights are half off wines after 8 pm, which is a good deal.  We had two bottles of the \Catching Venus\"" Sauvignon Blanc, which was a good wine...and when we ordered it half price, it was $22 for the bottle.  The menu looked divine, so I will definitely be going back to try everything I couldn't last night.\n\nI had the cheese plate and there is an adequate selection of cheeses to pick from (for the small plate, you get your choice of three).  I chose the sharp cheddar (basic but delicious), brie, and chevre (my favorite of the three). The plate comes with a large amount of bread, some green apples, and a bowl of grapes.  I tried some of a friend's green apple and brie bruschetta, and I definitely did not enjoy it as much as the bruschetta at Postino.  The apple and brie bruschetta at Armitage didn't have enough brie on it for my liking and the flavor was a bit bland.  \n\nA great spot at DC Ranch and I can imagine on weekends it is quite the scene.

Went today with a pal during lunch time and holy moley, it was CROWDED! You wonder where everyone in Arizona is in the summer? At Five Guys, sheesh! My pal insisted I order the \""little burger\""... and even though I told her I was ravenous, she said, \""no, you want the LITTLE burger\"". Expecting a slider sized burger, I was surprised to see it was completely normal sized, maybe even a bit bigged than an In and Out. I was also pleasently surprised because they say their burgers are \""well-done and juicy\"". I myself, like my burgers still moo-ing. Well, I could barely tell they were well done, and Holy Mary, it was the juiciest burger I had ever had! The fries were hot, fresh, and still had the potato skin on, amazing. It is a little on the pricey side. I should have ordered the small fries, but like I said, I was starving, and ordered the big ones. My friend had a hot dog and it looked pretty good. My fave thing: endless topping INCLUDED! Wahooooo! It is definetly a great place to check out, maybe next time I will just get take out, cause it was a bit crowded. I did love the old fashioned feel, with the potato sacks everywhere and the open kitchen with fry cooks chettering away in their crazy kitchen jargon.

The front of the restaurant is a \country store\"" selling knick knacks, road trip items, penny candy and some plain odd-ball crap.  The decor is all clap board, complete with an old porch, rocking chairs and barrels to play checkers on while you wait.  The walls are hung with what I assume is partially authentic paraphanelia from the 40's such as old rolling pins, spice cans, signs etc.  \n\nThere was normally a short wait or no wait at all.  This review is based only eating breakfast.  The ex had no interest in their lunch or dinner items.  Their biscuits are solid, the gravy is okay but could use more flavor if I'm burning my calorie quota, the applesauce, grits, pancakes and eggs... all okay.  Being a potato freak, of course, I LOVE the cheesy potato hash!  \n\nLike the other reviewers here say, it's a solid performer.  Always consistent.  Always the same.  Prices are reasonable and service is friendly.  One of those places safe to bring your family to for a Sunday meal or out of towners hungry for breakfast.

I was really in need of some Pho, stat!\n\nI contemplated heading to the Pho shop down the street from my work but really didn't like there egg noodles...and yes, I know it's not Pho if you don't have rice noodles, it's just Mi.\n\nI head into this place and the door was held open, incense pouring out the door and there was about 4 people in there. The lady told me to sit anywhere I wanted but the only table that was for less than 6 people was between the shrine that was burning incense and the door that was open. Not a very good place to sit if you're not feeling well.\n\nI hopped onto a seat that was on the opposite side of the room and seated about 8 people and was surprised not to get yelled at. The table was a bit dirty but...that's what ice water and napkins are for!\n\nI ordered what I always do, spring rolls and the egg noodle seafood soup, Mi. \n\nI waited a bit and finally got my spring rolls. They were actually really good, big and stuffed with a lot of shrimp and cilantro!  I love cilantro and it's rare that I find someone that puts so much into the spring rolls. Yum.\n\nI got through half of the first roll and out came my soup. There was a lot of shrimp, fish balls and so on in there and the egg noodles were the ones that I like...not the flat ones like the \other place\"". \n\n I was bummed, no red vinegar on the table...I loaded up my bowl with all the veggie fixings and took a sip...WOW the soup was actually very good! I don't put any soy sauce or hoisen sauce into the soup until I give it a taste and I was very surprised. It is rare that I don't have to put much into the soup. I actually almost finished all the soup in the bowl. Very cool.\n\nI didn't like the fact that no one came to refill my water and I also had to just go up to the counter to pay my bill since the waitress seemed to be running around like a chicken with her head cut off.\n\nI wish I could give this place more stars but they just seem to be very unorganized.

3905,2018-03-15 20:15:12,"My husband and I decided to try this place because we had won a gift card at our daughter's school's silent auction. We arranged for childcare and went out to the casino on a Sunday night. The ambiance is seriously lacking due to \windows\"" that open up into the casino allowing sound and smoke to invade like a flock of rabid pigeons at a garden party. We were seated at a tiny table in a corner in front of the aforementioned windows. This definitely was not adding to the desired \""date\"" feel. \n\nThe menu was that of a posery \""Bamboo Club\"" but lacked much of the club's appeal (and that's not saying much). We are very familiar with Asian food as my husband is Chinese and I was raised in a Chowhouse. The food was definitely not what one would could authentic, but more of a merely adequate take on fusion. We started with the Ahi appetizer. I believe we enjoyed the slaw it was served on more than the fish itself, as it was none too impressive. We decided to share an entree because we wanted to do three courses. For this we chose the seafood hot pot. I thought the sauce was good, but did not warrant the green curry label. I also thought salmon was a strange choice for the fish chunks in the dish. A white fish would have taken on the curry flavor much better. Salmon isn't something I really expect in cooked Asian dishes. When we ordered this dish, the waitress recommended that we not get the fried rice because the dish was \""more like a stew\"". We hadn't even discussed fried rice because we knew what what we were ordering. Maybe this is a suggestion that should be reserved for people who ask for fried rice to avoid sounding condescending. \n\nThe desserts were decidedly not Asian, despite making a dessert spring roll. We tried the creme brulee because I'm a sucker for it. A little bit grainy IMO but it had a good flavor. \n\nWhen it came time to settle the bill, all love was lost. They do not take Ling and Louie's gift cards! This was the sole reason we tried this place. The manager was sent over and dealt with us in a very patronizing (emphasis on very) tone about how he just couldn't do anything about it. When the waitress (Brittani?) returned she inquired what he had done to help and we told her nothing ,and that we were pretty angry. She then left for awhile and came back, telling us that she had asked him (the manager) to take off the entree and my hot tea. He did this, but only after she told him that we had considered leaving our gift card and splitting. Seriously, I have never considered a dine and dash until this jerk spoke to me like I was a four year old who had eaten too many cookies. Thanks Brittani, you're doing what it takes to make customers happy. Your manager, however, will rip the proverbial mask from the lackluster ambiance and flavors and expose this place for what it really is, a casino food stand. Think I'll go to Panda Express next time.""",xGl8vG07,2162

Perfect spot to grab a bite before a ball game downtown (not near the rail line).  \n\nJust know what to expect-- it's a deli counter in a middle eastern market in a \questionable\"" neighborhood.  The tables are aluminum and rickety, so I usually take it to go.\n\nThe hummus is the best in town, as is the pita.  I usually take an extra order of both to bring home for the week.  The baba ganaouj is good and very smokey, but I prefer the hummus.\n\nI've tried every sandwich on the menu.  The best is the chicken shwarma.  Rotisserie chicken, shredded and seared crisp on the griddle, then folded into a pita with garlic spread, tomato, lettuce and pickle.  They are small and amazing, so I always get two.  The beef shwarma is also good.  \n\nThe kebab sandwiches are very tasty, but the pieces of meat are huge and difficult to eat in sandwich form.  Better off getting kebab plates.""",t6nGrI5V,1737

It's NOT like subway at all actually...\n\nI have always had great sandwiches from here and have always had a lot of meat stuffed in, to the point to where a big sandwich basically makes 2 meals for me.  The stuff is always fresh and tastes super good so, no problems there.\n\nI will give a word to the wise tho... Although it's very good... \Mikes Way\"" has them put a bunch of oil & vinegar on and if you plan on keeping half for dinner or next day be careful w/ mikes way as it'll saturate the bread over time.  Mikes Way eaten right away is the bomb tho... loves it.  Just heads up.\n\nI will say they do take some time to make the food, and lunch time can get pretty busy and lengthy so they'll want to work on that.  But they slice the meat for every sandwich and it seems that may be part of the backup.  I've gone in there at night to pickup food on the way home and it didn't seem to take as long.\n\nPricey?  Eh... I'm not saying that... I think they're very competitive and I've never thought that the times I've been there.  Not as much as Capriotti's but not as cheap as Subway... but subway sucks so lol... \n\nGood small patio for nice days to eat outside... good amount of inside seating but again gets busy at lunch (cause it's good) and the one downside is they only have Pepsi products.... fail...

She also graciously offered to comp my meal, which I told her she didn't have to do. I have to say, with that kind of attitude by a business owner, no one can argue that she doesn't care about the place or its customers.

I have been verbally accosted in public by total strangers, I have watched people literally beat their children and spouses in the grocery store and today I had to call the Highway Patrol while a guy was stalking me on the freeway (as a side note, Highway Patrol couldn't have cared less). \n\n- Religious nuts, Mormons, corrupt politicians and right wing Conservatives. And I am from Chicago... we invented corrupt politicians and Arpaio makes Daley look like a friggin amateur. \n\n- Terrible schools \n\n- Poorly made homes \n\n- The Devil himself won't even visit here it's so hot. \n\n- Nothing to do unless you like to hike... the same mountain... all the friggin time. Lame. No culture, no nightlife (unless u r a cougar or a wh*re), the music scene is a joke, and their idea of a happy hour \special\"" is a $6 glass of wine. \n\n- Like another poster said.. great job market, if you want to work in a call center. If you have a Bachelor's be prepared for the \""overqualified\"" speech; have a Master's and forget about it! \n\n- dirty, gang tags everywhere, homeless people all over. \n\n- cookie cutter big box retailers all over the place. I could post a picture on here of any town in the Valley and it could be anywhere from Queen Creek to Buckeye and you wouldn't be able to tell me cuz it all looks the same. \n\n- Worst drivers, ever! \n\n- broke ass state that has mismanaged it's funds, despite our ridiculous local sales tax rates, crazy car registration fees ($600 a year for a new car, and we're talking a Honda people), and various govt money making schemes (speed cameras anyone?) \n\nOh I could go on and on, but bottom line, don't bother. Unless you are forced to visit or relocate, there is no reason to come here... there are too many other places to choose from. \n\nGo ahead, let the hate mail begin... I will just delete and block you anyway.""",EDIjGCYf,4208

This place is locally owned by a couple of immigrants from Poland. They offer fantastic tasting Polish food and have exceptional customer service.   \n\nNow, I'm not a \beet\"" person so when I was asked to sample their red borscht-beet soup I was apprehensive to the point of making a grimmest face. But to my surprise it was delicious! We ordered some soup de jour, pierogi's both cheese and smoke sausage with onions for apps.  These pierogi's were amazing!  The best I've had in quite some time.  \n\nSince it was lunch we opted away from the delicious looking Polish Plate Specials and went for their gourmet sandwiches.  We had their Fresh Mozzarella, basil and tomato on cibatta bread toasted with their vinaigrette dressing.  It was very fresh and tasty. We also had a smoked polish sausage on a cibatta bun with their sauerkraut-slaw and mustard.  It too was very good and huge! We had to take half of it to-go. They have a lot of homemade deserts to choose from including Cheese Blintzes and Kolaczki Cookies, which we had both the apricot and raspberry ~ delish!!\n\nThe Touch of European Cafe is very small and popular so you may need to call ahead of time when dinning indoors for dinner.  They have outdoor seating which is perfect for dinning for lunch of dinner when the weather is nice. They are BYOW so you can bring your own favorite bottle of wine!  \n\nWe are looking forward to our next visit, this time it will be dinner.  Planning to bring a nice bottle of Pinot Noir to go with either some Hunter Stew or some Stuffed Cabbage Rolls along with a side of pierogi's of course!  I might even have their soup de jour again!""",CyNzEd9b,1493

3951,2018-02-25 11:11:47,The Wigwam is down the street from my house so I often frequent there and I have had family stay there. I love this place - especially after all the renovations. It is beautiful and the staff is so professional and courteous. The history of the property is very interesting and the pictures and picture albums throughout the buildings is a very nice touch. No one is perfect and stuff happens so when it does these guys go out of their way to make it right. You can tell they love their jobs and appreciate your business. The pool is awesome and the new outside bar area with the new bocci court is wayyy cool to hang out by the fire pit. You can even roast marshmallows and make s'mores. The farmers market on weekends is a fun place to find some local produce too. The Wigwam is a true gem on the west side; adjacent to Blu Sushi and Taps - two other highly recommended establishments. To all the locals: check it out- the bar is a cool place to meet friends for drinks and have fun in an upscale but non pretentious atmosphere- something missing in the west valley.,er6MVFST,1558
3952,2018-01-04 03:15:43,"Wow! wow! Wow! I understand why you are a Triple A Five Diamond Reward and voted as Forbes Five Star Award restaurant...not only are you very crafty, creative and detailed with your culinary dishes but also your attention to art and how you integrated it with the atmosphere and whole dining experience. This place has all the feel of being..Native American? Well it is on a Indian Reserve....but it's like really fancy Native American decor...they have different paintings for each menu...and the waiter told us that it changes every time so even when you go back you'll see a different painting on the menu. The menu is also cleverly named too...instead of appetizer, small bites, and entree...they replaced it with \the birth\"", \""the beginning\"" and \""the journey\"" each corresponding to the amount of food each one serves. I'm giving it 4 stars for the atmosphere alone. =)  \n\nMy bf made reservations at this place for 5:45pm but we were stuck in traffic for a while and my bf gave them a call telling them we would be a little late..this place is located in a far off resort and spa of Wild Horse Pass..not that easy to find but it's really nice and quiet around this area in Chandler.\n\nWhen we arrived the hostess referred to us as Mr. and Mrs. Li....I was about to correct her but my bf thought it would be funny just to say yes..haha so the whole night they just referred to us as Mr. Li or Mrs. Li..  Oi one thing I notice throughout the whole night is that -- there are NO YOUNG people here....my bf and I were the youngest couple here....other people were at least 40 and above. This is a pricey restaurant.....but why no young people here on Friday night? I guess they rather spend $$$$ at clubs or something..hehe maybe not just saying.\n\nWell let's get on with the food review, shall we? They served us three selections of some pretty good breads and olive oil to start off with..then they gave us each a tablespoon of chef's special dumplings with toasted parsley and after that we got Guava sherbet with Pomegranate Reduction....DELISH! After all the little complimentary foods, we finally got to order...\n\n They do have a tasting menu but that's not what we tried this time...instead we started off with a Lobster, Pumpkin & Mesquite Grilled Squash Bisque...it was not only yummy but so cool! they bring out a plate with lobster, avocado and pepita seeds arranged below a swirl of meringue..then they set it on fire with a small torch to toast the meringue then putting off the fire by pouring in the bisque! haha that's was really cool. \n\nFor entree, I had the juicy, tender and super flavorful Red Deer Venison Loin with Sage infused Gnocchi....usually not a fan of gnocchi but they made it really tasty! My bf had their most famous dish...Grilled Tenderloin of Tribal Buffalo...I really love the Sweet Corn Puree on this dish...the buffalo meat was also very tender and flavorful...both meats were pretty much melt in your mouth goodness.\n\nThen for dessert we had the interesting Creme Brulee Cones....there were three Saguaro Seed Cones filled with different flavors of brulee in each...sweet corn, sweet vanilla and winter squash pudding. Topped with strawberry cotton candy that was sprinkled with chili. Very interesting....but I was not very fond of the sweet corn one...the others were really good.\n\nThe service was pretty good too, although what impressed me was at the end when my bf and I were walking out the hostess greeted us goodnight and said the waiter would like to further thank you for dining with us tonight...and handed us a card and little nicely wrapped bag of truffle and chocolate strawberry. I was like wow...that's really nice of them to actually write a thank you card! haha \n\nThis place is definitely great for special occasions or when you feel like really splurging! but like I said we were the youngest couple this night...and I honestly don't think they see too many people in their 20's here.....\n\nOverall I had a wonderful evening at this restaurant and hope to come here again and try out their tasting menu =)""",cTQ0VOdf,1205

We walked in on a weekday around 11, the place was pretty packed and there was only one server on the floor. We grabbed a table and waited about 10 minutes before she came over with water. We told her were ready to order, to which she replied \I am really busy and have other people who need to order ahead of you.\"" In my 16 years as a chef, I have never heard a server say that. She didn't even offer to bring us coffee or anything. If anyone from Joe's is reading this, here's a little crash course in restaurant 101...if a customer says they're ready to order, TAKE THEIR DAMN ORDER! Anyway, we ended up walking out.

I wont go into detail about why I was seeking therapy, although I will tell you of my horrid interaction with this man. \nThe office waiting room is dirty, with dust-bunnies and random hairs all over the floor. The glass the receptionist sits behind and all of the furniture is out of the 80s. I would swear they all have not been cleaned since then. The receptionist was sweet and helpful... this is the only reason the office got one star. The tile floor looked like it had never been mopped or cleaned since the 80s when the furniture was purchased. \nWhen I am walked into the Doctor's office for the first time he tells me to sit down. No introduction. No \nice to meet you\"". Nada.. Just have a seat and an awkward giggle. He laughed at almost everything I said. I'm not sure why you as the reader is considering a therapist, but I know for myself, I wasn't there to pay someone to laugh at me or for some kind of comic stand up session. \nHis type of therapy did NOT work for me in the least. With the frequent questions of \""how does that make you feel\"" and \""how depressed are you\"". ARE YOU KIDDING ME? How depressed am I? I am not the one with a PHD. If I knew how depressed I was and how the eff to fix it.. I wouldn't need to sit on your stained whit leather couch in the dim sunlight room. \nHe asks me if I remember my dreams... because some people write dream journals and come to him to have them interpreted. I am all for metaphysical stores and psychic readings.. But I go to psychics for this not a psychologist. Nor do I make life choices from a dream interpretation. \nI was asked to come into the office early to fill out forms. Four pages of questions and a signature page. The first things he asks me when I walk in and sit down are every single question from that form. So I asked, why did I just spend 30 minutes filling out that form for you to ask me the same questions? His answer: because I like to hear you say the words. Seriously? Then don't have me come in early to fill out four pages of questions and come in early. \nI am a single mother and a busy person. I am the type of person that likes to get straight to the point and not candy coat or beat around the bush. I found his approach more than annoying.\nHe then starts accusing me of not answering his questions fully and being combative. The question that led to his accusing me and arguing with me was if any of my other therapist had gotten to the point where they understood why I couldn't get over the fact that my boyfriend killed himself. Let me also tell you it has been less than a year since my BF passed away. \nAt that point, which was about 20 minutes in, I walked out after a few choice words. Maybe his approach may work for older people or someone who has never been to therapy. \nI hope this was helpful.""",qEwmvEHb,4738

The bartender made the lemon drop and added a splash of Rasp liqueur in at the end to make it \extra special. Quickly a hot basket of garlic bread arrived. Yay luv garlic bread. We ordered stuffed mushroom to start. Not my choice but hey they were good. It was so difficult deciding what to order due to their amazing menu. I finally decided on a shrimp fettuccine dish that was prepared with cognac, cream, wild mushrooms and shrimp. Orgasmic doesn't cover it. These were huge lump shrimp that tasted like lobster. By far one of the most memorable dishes I have eaten in years. Husband ordered Gnocchi. Wow amazing delicate covered in tomato cream sauce, made hrs before our arrival.

3968,2018-04-22 18:27:03,"Compared to the various other cookie cutter Sushi spots, this one really stands out. The happy hour is to die for considering location and the general prices in Scottsdale. The quality of the sushi is also much different compared to general places out here. You will see that the prices at general times are very pricey for certain dishes ($15 for a seven piece roll?!?!). \n\nOne thing to point out is that this was the first time in around 2 years since i had come back. The wait staff on the last occasion were so poor that my date and I chose to leave. It seemed like a good idea, because the 20 something waitress was caught in her own bubble egregiously flirting with  five 40 year old dudes. So, to say the least, the service has gotten better than when I last went. The past few times I had gone I also was provided the typical snobby reactions that you get from wait-staff in Scottsdale. Much different this time. Our waitress was kind and understood where we were all coming from (I was in a party of 4). So at least from this time around the waitress was good.\n\nI guess in Yelp language that would mean the service is \hit or miss\"", haha.\n\nAnyway, despite the service the food is well worth any issues I have previously had. The only major hang up I won't let go is that it's truly not worth it at regular times, unless you have that type of money to go through. Sushi selection though, is top notch and this is one of my fav's when I am in the area and really craving sushi. Please try to make your first trip one to their happy hour so you can breathe a little easier when browsing the menu. If you like it, then maybe you can inch into regular hours.""",sCOKt4rk,3462

A friend and I have birthdays within two days of each other, and they won't let us both use the birthday coupons at the same time. Annoying, but allowable. We decided to go twice and just split the bill both times.\n\nThe first visit, as a standalone, would have been a two star review. I ordered the blue cheese fillet. The \blue cheese\"" was some unappetizing whipped butter with a slight taste of blue cheese that was very disappointing. I'm used to steak houses that have tasty blue cheese crumbles on the steak, not a whipped concoction. Their French onion soup is very good though. The waiter on this night was very phony and icky-sweet and would be better suited to sell insurance instead of work at a restaurant.\n\nWe weren't really looking forward to the second visit, but decided to give it a second chance and not order the same thing. It would have scored a four star review on the visit last night. I ordered the peppercorn steak which had a tangy mushroom sauce on top along with lots and lots of peppercorns. Twice baked potato was great as well. I ordered a side of creamy horseradish for the steak. We had the Tempura Snap Peas & Asparagus for an appetizer which were an odd choice for a steak house, but were very good nonetheless. Our waitress was attentive, fun, and knowledgeable. Just what you want. \n\nWill I go back? Next year for the birthday meal for sure, but otherwise is a tossup. The Keg kind of falls in the middle ground of steak restaurants. I love Lone Star for a casual steak and if I want a great date-night or special event steak, I will always go to either Durant's or Fleming's.

That being said I had a bad experience with the front desk and check out service.\n\nFor this fabulous hotel I would've expected better customer service. I was here on business and with a large group who was taking care of my stay. When I checked out they said they had a glitch and they'd have to fix it to get that payment through the group and assured me they would work it out. A week later I checked my credit card statement online and sure enough they had charged the bill to my account not the business group I was with. After several phone calls I had it straightened out but I don't think it's acceptable for the front desk to assure me they would when clearly it wasn't within their power and something I needed to follow up on.

4004,2018-05-14 14:14:35,"I write this because I actually care about this place. Gameworks opened in 1997. I was actually part of the opening crew. I only worked there about 6 months but I loved it so much I would make it my weekly haunt for several years.  At that time Gameworks kept up with the gaming market which of course has gone down severely since console and computer gaming has become more popular. However, Gameworks was never a game room or an arcade. For the first year that it was opened you could have money deducted from your paycheck if you referred to Gameworks as either one of those in the presence of a manager. Gameworks was an experience. It's originating concept was what would happen if a bunch of 90's tweens were to find an old abandoned building that was powered by \Surge\"" soda. The magical new super caffeinated mountain dew alternative for tweens living the extreme.  \n\nThe credit system they used was supposed to be easy on parents and tweens alike. Mom or Dad could buy a card that could be used in every part of Gameworks excluding the bar. That way a kid didn't have to carry around actual money and could play games, get a burger and fries, drink some SURGE!!!! ect.ect.  Video games had cup holders and fries were served in cups so kids could snack as they played. \n\nUpstairs there was a coffee bar, a regular bar, and a full restaurant. They had leather couches and chairs in parts of the bar and coffee bar. They had an area for retro 80's games. Most importantly they had two special attractions known as Vertical Reality and the INDY 500. In the middle of the upstairs they had a professional sound and video board with some of the latest equipment available at the time. They had actual DJ's that were called Play Jockeys controlling video and audio feeds to the 5 different quadrants of the building. During the initial year of opening I witnessed lines outside the door of people trying to get in the door . They had over a thousand people riding the indy 500 hundred  each week during the summer. They had contest with great prizes like Superbowl tickets, Harley Davidson, and one Halloween they gave away a stand up House of the Dead arcade game. \n\nNow the decline-\nEvery company has a vision and talking points that they pass off as their do's and don'ts. Gameworks always wanted  to have staff available to assist people. The first notice of decline of course was under staffing. No longer were people greeting others, giving them a random free play on the games. Instead of running multiple lines of Vertical reality which had multiple bays they would only keep open one or two.  Instead of having announcers always stationed at indy 500 a sign was put in place that said see attendant for assistance.  Secondly the one golden rule they swore they would never, ever, ever, EVER BREAK... Gameworks will never have redemption games. Tickets were considered evil, instead they had a gift shop where you could buy things like shirts, shot glasses, and all kinds of other crap you could possibly find as prizes at other places.  They day I walked in and saw the first game spitting tickets and the words redemption, I felt I was kicked in the nuts. The final straw would be the multiple changes to the bar. Certain liquors, beers, ect were gone. Certain specialty drinks gone. Great bartenders gone. Happy hour host and play jockey's gone. The music is now a loop, the play Jockey audio and visual station is not used. Last time I was in there the bartenders were using jigs, had no flair, and most importantly were more concerned with trying to  get the one girl who was in the bar to talk to them instead of making money by serving drinks, up selling, and keeping conversation with multiple patrons. Gone was the once warm inviting atmosphere, and instead I felt like I was having a drink poured for me by a 21 year old holding a liquor bottle for the first time. \n\nAt this point the once great establishment that I have spent thousands of dollars at between 97 and 2007 has become a poor depressing shell of what it once was. You could actually close the bar, get rid of the restaurant and put a pizza place upstairs and they could probably pull off a chucky cheese gig and be more profitable then what they appear to me. \n\nOpportunities for improvement-\nIt is my firm belief that Gameworks has the chance to reinvent themselves if they would try a radical approach . At this time they have at least 3 or 4 great spaces that they could potentially use for LAN gaming and console gaming. It would very easy to set up multiple consoles and a internal LAN and do a pay for the hour or day thing. Much like Howie's game shack in mesa riverview. They also need to go back to the night club ambiance after 8pm. Bring back the play jockeys and the hostesses. Bring back that feeling of warmth.""",oYpXWOw6,890

That is pretty hefty cost for a burger and splitting a medium order of fries.\n\nThey do have a nice beer list and the cupcakes that are made next door and served as a dessert here are delicious but this doesn't outweigh the high cost, low amount fries, and the awful conversations you have to put up with (this is a personal view, and why I don't live in scottsdale).\n\nI'd recommend checking out Soma Cafe for a better burger + sweet potato fries.""",DiVdf81g,971

My dinner companion also enjoys football so I asked the hostess if we could still use my gift card in the bar, she kindly told us, \""sure, as long as you order off the dinner menu.\"" Perfect. \n\nI quickly realized that my $50 wasn't going to get me very far. Most entrees were in the $30+ range and everything was a la carte. I ordered the scallops with puff pastry and veggies. For my side, what else but macaroni and cheese.  The scallops were very good. Cooked perfectly. The puff pastry wasn't bad either. The macaroni and cheese on the other hand was sublime (I hate that word, but I couldn't think of another way to describe it). My dining companion also has a fantastic fillet and his sauteed mushrooms was a bit garlicky, but also very good. He had a fillet at Ruth's Chris recently and told me the Flemings steak won hands down. I knew I should have ordered a steak!  \n\nI know that Flemings is part of a large corporate chain, and I hate chains, but I have to admit my dinner experience here was great.

4051,2018-01-29 16:49:28,"My son and I visited CPK Desert Ridge on May 12th after a movie at the AMC. I recall eating at a CPK at The Mirage in Las Vegas over 18 years ago and I remember it being good and kinda the latest trend. We were promptly greeted and seated. The host was great. HOWEVER, It was at least 15 mins. before any waiters acknowledged us. When one did, she wasn't our waiter but said she would give our drink order to our waiter. Probably 2 mins later our waiter came with our drinks FINALLY. We placed our order immediately in hopes of eating sometime in this decade. Since it had been so long since I'd eaten at a CPK, I asked the waiter if one pizza was enough for 2 people and he said no. So we ordered two, one kinda traditional pizza with pep, sausage etc and one chicken tostada pizza. I'd guess 10 mins passed by the time our food came, with which we were pleased. When I saw how big they were, I was kinda surprised. We would have been more than full on one pizza. But I can't fault the waiter for that. He had no way of knowing if we are big eaters or not. We dug in. I first had a slice of the chicken tostada. My son, the meat pizza. Mine was \okay\"" not a whole lot of flavor even with the salsa. My son's however was really yummy. I ended up having a slice of his since he was raving about it. He then had a slice of mine and he said the same thing, kinda boring and no taste. We ended up leaving with 2 half pizzas. I'm sure I would have given them a better score had it not been for the slowness of the waiter checking on us. Would I go back, yes, but I'd ask to be seated in the large dining room, not off to the side where we were seated, I'm sure that is why we were ignored for so long.""",HX5rvK9n,4049

4053,2018-04-18 04:36:41,"When Stevey P asked me if I wanted to go to the first game at Camelback Ranch I jumped at the chance.  Its been a long winter and I need some baseball!\n\nThe stadium itself is beautiful, the natural rock walls give it a very \Arizona\"" feel.  The sight lines from our lawn seats were pretty good and they have a decent amount of seating in several different lawn sections.  The complex is large, with multiple practice fields, manicured lawns, walkways and waterways.  The replica stadium fields are a nice touch.  \n\nThere were some aspects of my experience here that really detracted from the day.  First of all, the parking situation is ridiculous.  One would imagine that having a large open space to build this complex would allow for a better design for the parking lot but its just a huge mess.  Also, the parking lot is really far from the stadium itself, you have to cross the entire complex to get there.\n\nThe concessions also left much to be desired, it was pretty much your standard stadium fare.  The service at the concession stands really needs work.  It wasn't that they didn't have enough people, they were certainly well staffed, but they really need to figure out a system to speed up the process.  I'm sure it will come with time.  Also, my hot dog was pretty lackluster and my hot pretzel was as hard as a rock.  If you have ever been to a game with me you know that I love stadium food.  LOVE IT.  So this bummed me out.\n\nTwo other notes.  First, the music they play is incredibly loud.  It needs to be lowered a few notches.  Second, while the prices of lawn seats are what you would expect to pay, they do have seats that approach the $100 range.  For spring training?!\n\nAll in all it was a fun afternoon.  Given its location it wouldn't be a stadium I would go to often but I can see myself going once a season.""",aDdWo8my,205

4070,2018-04-09 18:00:44,It is hard to find flaws with the Cornish Pasty. I used to go to the Tempe location on a regular basis and while I loved the place the lack of space was a detrement if you were trying to go with more than 2 people. The Mesa location is by far much larger than its Tempe counterpart. It has the bar style seating as the Tempe site but also has a large open patio as well as large indoor tables with old church pues for the seats. This alone makes the Mesa site better.\n\nThe food speaks for itself. I've had practically every pasty available on the menu and have yet to find one that didn't taste good. The side sauces that come with them are delicious. The mustard sauce and red wine gravy are my favorites. \n\nThe beer selection is excellent. I only wish they had Newcastle on tap. The only problem with the beer at the Mesa site is that they can't serve it in 34oz mugs like the Tempe site. The limit in Mesa is 32oz and can be chalked up to Mormon population who more or less run Mesa. At least they have the $3 all day/any day carbombs.\n\nThe service is more often than not excellent. I do wish Dean (the owner) was here more often. He is a stand up guy.\n\nI'll be moving out of state soon and will definately miss the Cornish Pasty.,4oomvhY2,356

4084,2018-01-05 21:24:26,"After living around the corner from this joint for almost a year, I decided to venture in. I had previously avoided the place because I am from NY and am often disappointed by pizza. I just wasn't up to it. I would rather make the 23 mile drive to Ray's in Scottsdale. Besides, this place kept sending me coupons and I figured any business that has to do so much direct mail advertising probably does not have a product that speaks for itself.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nIt was a chilly Friday afternoon when I finally succumbed to the call of pizza. I walked into the glorified shoebox of a place (a good sign) and was immediately disappointed that there were no slices on display. I like to look at them before I order. Then I can be prepared for way to much cheese or to thick a crust or some other pizza travesty. I was actually only here to look, so I told myself and the guy behind the counter.\n\nWell since my super hero power is supreme lack of self control around potentially delicious items, I ordered a slice. Every day from 11am to 3pm they have a slice and a soda for $4. I didn't think this was a huge deal because in my head a slice still should cost $1.50. That makes the soda what, $2.50?\n\nWell I was a little more than floored when my slice arrived at the table. It was served on a pizza pan with a rolling cutter. Why, you may inquire? Because the damned thing was bigger than my head! Apparently it's a slice of a 24 inch pie. OK, so maybe the $4 was a good deal after all.\n\nAs I have been so trained to do by my years on that fish- shaped island, I pressed my right thumb into the middle of the crust to help create the perfect pizza fold. A delicious crunch accompanied the saucy steam rising off my pie. And the whole thing held itself up as I prepared to take my first bite.\n\nTangy sauce, not too much cheese, crunchy crust... nice. I can't wait to try their specialty pies- the Popeye looks amazing.

4095,2018-01-11 03:44:57,"One Stop Appliance Repair is exactly that.  They will make one stop to your house for a service call diagnosis and then never return.  I have a LG dishwasher that broke and very few companies work on LG products because of their very unique parts.  I called several companies who said they would love my business but didn't work on LG products.  I found One Stop Appliance Repair online and saw that they worked on LG, had same day service and a military discount.  The technician, Francisco, came within an hour and quickly diagnosed my problem as a burst drainage hose.  He could order the part and repair it.  The new hose would come in 3-5 business days and he would call when it arrived.  The price to fix it was $205, which I thought was a little steep but I was willing to put up with it since I needed a dishwasher right away.  Over a week goes by and I hear nothing from Francisco.  I call the office and they are very apologetic but only tell me to call Francisco.  I call Francisco and he says the part must have been lost (or he forgot to order it) and said he would order it again, same 3-5 day delivery.  Once again more than a week goes by and I hear nothing.  I call the office and they tell me to call Francisco.  I call Francisco and he says, \Oh yeah, I got the part.  Its in my truck.  I tried to call you but never heard back\""  I had called and left him two messages on his cell phone.  He agrees to come the next day to install the new hose.  The next day he calls and says he won't be able to make it and reschedules for the following day, Friday.  I call him Friday when he again hasn't arrived and he says the office scheduled him for work in the East Valley (I am in Central PHX).  I call the main office to see if any technicians are available today to install my hose and I am met with a great deal of attitude by the receptionist Nikki.  She says that the earliest anyone could come would be Saturday morning.  I told her that I had already had 2 appointments cancelled and that I needed a guarantee that a 3rd cancellation wasn't going to happen.  She said she couldn't guarantee that but said Francisco would be there tomorrow.  I called back and asked to speak to the owner of the business and Nikki said he was out of town and would be back on Monday.  I asked for his name and she said \""T\"".  I asked if he had a whole name or if he only had a letter.  She said he only had the letter T.  I asked for his phone number and she refused to give it to me.  I then said that it sounded like she was running a criminal organization and she huffed and hung up the phone.  I have since filed a complaint with the Attorney Generals Office.  At the very least they will have some governmental intrusion to make their day that much worse.  \""T\"" is in fact Trampas Jenkins.  I wonder what he has to hide?  If you actually want to get something fixed and don't want to be scammed and treated rudely, call someone else.""",FsAIcJWY,3516

It's always been the place to go in the middle of the night after you drank too much and the food is \decent\"" because you are lacking a sense of logic.\nToday my boyfriend and I had the choice between Chili's, Denny's, or random fast food. I never liked Chili's all that much and fast food is always last on my list so we stopped in to this location for a late lunch. \n\nWe were seated in a booth next to a mother and her daughter, with an older gentleman further away. For some reason the man and teen started talking about a newspaper and this turned into them chit-chatting the entire time, which annoyed the mom so much she actually asked the girl to stop talking and eat her burger and cleared her throat several times when the daughter continued to yap. A very awkward albeit hilarious restaurant moment. The topics ranged from Lord of the Ring books, Twilight and the writer living somewhere in AZ, ghosts and dogs that bark at walls/ghosts, and a whole lot of other fairy crap. I'm only writing about this because it was literally all we heard for 80% of the time we spent there, and it was something you couldn't ignore because they were talking so loud. We would of asked to move to the other side of the restaurant but it seemed like there was only one waitress and everyone was grouped together to make it easier for her I'm guessing. \n\nThe only thing that distracted us from all the noise was the food when it came out. I had the lemon tilapia with veggies and coleslaw, my bf ordered pancakes and buffalo wraps (so random!) From the first bite I was alarmed, in such a good way. I've never had such wonderful food at Denny's! The fish was cooked perfectly and seasoned just right, the veggies were fresh, and the coleslaw was your average recipe but still done well. I had a bite of the pancakes and buffalo wrap both, pancakes A+ and the wrap was good, nothing spectacular. It came with tortilla chips and salsa that to our surprise were also very good considering where we were eating. The water was eh but not many restaurants serve water to my liking (except California Pizza Kitchen, yum) but our waitress was quick to keep them full. The manager came over once and apologized for interrupting, funny because it wasn't her causing all the commotion during the meal, and asked how everything tasted. We let her know how we felt and she gave me a pat on the back saying she was very happy we were enjoying it so much. I don't know what it is about sweet older ladies patting you on the back but it just feels so nice and takes you back in time to when you were a kid and had no worries or cares at all. \n\nEnough of that cheese fest, the bill came out to $20 and I have a feeling it would have been double that at Chili's with half the satisfaction upon leaving. \nAnother perk is that outside the doors they have a redbox. We have only seen them at grocery stores or pharmacies and gas stations, to see one outside of Denny's was pretty nifty and we decided to rent a movie for tonight.""",xJGmew3a,4250

We've eaten BBQ from coast to coast and quite a bit in the south so we've got \some\"" idea what BBQ is supposed to be. \nWe've been here on a couple occasions and both times the brisket tasted like pot roast and overdone, the pork was overdone/mushy and tasteless. \n\nThen we move to the sides, the ranch beans should stay at the ranch since I'd bet they only taste good if you've got a mouth full of trail dust after a hard day of riding. The slaw is good but only if you add some of their vinegar sauce to it. We stopped in on a night wherre they had fresh corn which we got. I can't believe they could destroy fresh corn like that but they did by boiling the heck out of it. Had they just smoked/grilled it it would have been fantastic!  What a waste.....\n\n The ribs..... well they're ribs and that's about all I can and will say about them. What many may not know about real BBQ is it should be able to stand on it's own flavor wise, sauce is supposed to be an accompaniment not the only flavor. \nThe best part of what we got was either the Steak Fingers or the bun the pork came on which is truly sad for what they charge. There's better BBQ to be had around AZ that's for certain and at this point would drive all the way to Anthem to the new bbq place before hitting here again. \nI guess if you're used to McRibs or it's free this place is wonderful but if you're paying I wouldn't waste the $$ until the owners get a clue.

Why are we paying 7-9 dollars to these corporate theaters? Over 90 percent of that revenue goes back to the studios so they can finance yet another crime against humanity starring Reese Witherspoon as the sassy single blonde.

You'd agree with me if you ever met any of the executives of Harkins in person.\n\n--Chandler Cinemas isn't just a place to see movies, it's a place to LOITER. There are arcades, a pool table, and even a bunch of COUCHES AND A BIG SCREEN TV! I'm not making this up. People actually sit around watching Comedy Central while waiting for their showtime. Harkins will throw you out for taking up the Dance Dance Revolution machine. And I know some of the more uppity theater patrons out there will scoff at all the teenagers climbing this place but dude, come the fuck on. You used to be that young with nowhere to go because unless it's a bar or sporting event there isn't shit to do around here. Get over yourself. The way I see it, if they're loitering in theater lobbies than they're not rear-ending people in parking lots or stealing from comic book shops. And that's a necessary evil I can handle. (In case your curious, the arcade machines they have include the original Simpsons side-scroller beat em up, Die Hard, Ms Pac Man, and Revolution X.

Some movies are so bad they're good. So naturally some places can be so low-brow and nasty that they're good. The floors are sticky and covered in popcorn. The walls of the lobby are plastered with movie posters and cardboard cutouts. The marquees over the theaters are those manual \put the letter in the box\"" kind that you see at gas stations. When you buy your ticket, you get your hand stamped. Like you're at a rock concert or amusement park. You know why they stamp your hand? So they don't have to check your ticket. Just shove that receipt all the way down to the bottom of your pants, dude, they don't want to see it. \n\n--THEIR CONCESSION STAND HAS A VALUE MENU!!! CC's has the best concession stand menu ever. From M&M cookies to pizza, they have everything you shouldn't eat in a movie theater but will anyway. A small soda and small popcorn (small in bizarro world measurements, meaning that it feeds 3 people) are only $4. You know what $4 gets you at Harkins? A disapproving, nonplussed grimace from the employee, that's what. I think $4 gets you a bag of reese's pieces. Maybe. I can't remember the last time I had candy in a movie theater that I didn't already smuggle in. You ever wonder why I'm always carrying that Wonder Woman bag? It's not for the aesthetic! The moral of this story: I love CC because I can do the math. \n\n--Last night I saw Goldfinger. Not the band, the Sean Connery-era James Bond flick with that famous bondage scene where the bad guy says \""No, Mr. Bond. I expect you to die!\"" You know what came before that? 2 Hours of Bond Trailers! I got to watch the entire history of James Bond in 2 hours. Granted, I'm pretty sure I'm in the minority on the \""people who likes trailers vs people who hate trailers vs people WHO FUCKING LOVE trailers\"" but this is my review, bitches! They have the best indie and B movie showings here. It's like those real, honest to Cthulu grindhouses I love but am totally not old enough to remember. Not to further express my blatant anti-Harkins bias, but I remember plenty of times that I've searched the entire Phoenix-Metropolitan area to see an indie film to find that they weren't showing it anywhere, not even at their precious little Camelview, which, let's face it, is not an independent theater, even if they show independent films. If Best Buy set up \""Second To Best Buy\"" and sold only \""indie\"" records, that wouldn't make them an independent record store. Holy shit, did I just develop the use of logic? I better not make this a habit, lest you all start expecting it from me.\n\nYeah, all that \""variety is the spice of life\"" hippie bullshit is great and all, but I think I've found the only flavor of movie theater I will ever need for the rest of my sentence, I mean, time living in the valley.""",DQZMECyz,147

4134,2018-04-18 10:10:05,"Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.  Moms all over the country for years have woken up to make the meal that breaks the fast of a long nights sleep.  But after a certain age, people forget about breakfast at home and look to other venues to start their day.  A good breakfast place is hard to find.  For the most part, restaurants set a up a line that is too quick to think about quality, and only thinks only of the amount of tables that they can serve, and though that is important, the flavor and prep of the food should not suffer in the process.  The find a restaurant that can do both is rare.\n The Breakfast Club is located on Scottsdale Road and Stetson Dr puts forth a valiant effort to bring back quality to an extremely busy establishment.  I've driven by before, and the line on a Sunday morning is out the door.  Upon entering the restaurant, one would see that there is a coffee bar in the back and seating for up to forty people.  There is seating available outside, but on a cold day, there are fewer people wanting the brave a brisk morning then there are fingers on a hand, but I am one of those people.  The friendly greeting from the hostess helped warm the morning, and I was seated immediately to a corner table outside.\n The menu is your atypical breakfast place, with foods ranging from the simplicity of the egg to the flavorful complexity is that is a Belgium Waffle topped with just about anything a good breakfast place would offer.  It was definitely a busy morning and the waitress was running around like an organized chicken with her head cut off.  The greeting was friendly as she took my drink order, coffee, and returned quickly with it.  My palate wanted something rich and my stomach wanted something filling, so we all agreed with a Belgium waffle and a side of sausage patties.\n I surfed the Internet thinking that with as busy as they are, I would have time to be nerdy and check my fantasy football team.  Oh, how I was wrong.  A vinaigrette bottle, filled with warm, rich maple syrup was brought to the table, and suddenly the food was promptly delivered.  First I took the butter and smothered it on my waffle.  A bad butter can kill a meal, but if I want to see what type of place this is, then I was going to go for it.  The people at the Breakfast Club must have known this, because the butter was fresh and whipped.  I dug into the waffle.  The rich flavors filled my mouth, and the mixture of butter, syrup and waffle brought a smile to my tongue.  Next I took a bite of the sausage patty.  Think and juicy, it was not too greasy as so many places, and was that perfect blend of fat and pork products.\n Enjoying every bite, I fully expect to come back again.  The bill was reasonable, and the food lived up to the slightly more than Denny's total.  I felt like I was pay for quality.  You might not want to serve detention on a Saturday, but if you are looking for a nice breakfast with friends, then the Breakfast Club is the place you want to go.  My only recommendation would be get there early, because it will fill up.  But if you have to wait, the food will sing to just for you, \Don't you forget about me,\"" and you won't.""",XSr3onBB,2545

But I was overall very disappointed in the food. The only thing I liked, honestly, was the bread and the wine. \n\nWe had the prosciutto fresh mozzarella dish and it was greasy, bland, salty and just bad. Our main dishes were the spaghetti carbonara, and it was such an Americanized \past with alfredo sauce\"" version of it. Very cheesey and creamy and way overpowering smoked pancetta. It was truly awful.  And at $16 or $18 a plate, hardly worth it and far from what traditional pasta carbonara should be. I'm not sure why restaurants use a cheesy alfredo sauce for carbonara, when it should be egg used for the consistency, not gobs of cheesy sauce. Bleh!\n\nThe atmosphere, wine and bread were good, but I can get that at home. Was sorely disappointed and felt the regret of spending $80 on a totally mediocre to bad experience with the food.\n\nI have yet to find good Italian food in the Phoenix area.

They have corn meal in them which might not appeal to a \""traditionalist\"", but they were very good nonetheless.  I had the Belgian waffle and it was very good too.  \n\nThe coffee was typical diner fare as well.  I would not call it drek as I am a coffee snob and roast green beans at home.

I really -don't- want to review this place, because I would hate for you all to find it and crowd it up, but since I'm a good Yelper, I'll share this gem with you!\n\nThis is our favorite Mexican food place to go to, hands down. The boy and I have probably, combined, been here six times already within the past six months. A couple of things that make it so popular for us that we go, on average, once a month? Their mailer coupons, which offer a \buy one get one free\"" lunch AND dinner special, and their (now) $2.99 margaritas. Last time we came, their margaritas (all the time, not just happy hour) were $1.99, but apparently too many of you already are catching on, so they've raised the price a bit.\n\nBut for two people who are broke as jokes (literally... boo!), we get stuffed AND drunk, or what I like to call \""fat and sassy.\""\n\nWe've never ordered anything from here that wasn't good... that is a comment from the boy, because while he ALWAYS tries something different, I always get the same thing. Why mess with perfection??\n\nMy favorite meal: the veggie burrito, which comes stuffed with spinach and other random veggie goodness, and guacamole IN the burrito-- awww yeah buddy! Side of Mexican rice and black beans (or you can be healthy and get a side of salad.) Get in my mouth!\n\nThe boy's favorite meal now is probably the chicken fajitas he had last night, but he's also had their enchiladas, a few of their fish dishes, and some of their \""combined plates\"", which are HUGE plates of food.\n\nPrices for full meals range from $7-$13, and the $13 plates that I've seen are huge! Most, if not all, dishes come with sides, like rice and beans or salad, and guacamole, so you're really getting your money's worth.\n\nLike someone else noted, you can get drunk here for cheap, albeit not as cheap as before. The drinks are $2.99, big and incredibly strong. Mi Pueblo knows what's up!\n\nWe walked out of there last night (using our BOGO coupon) for $25, including tip and 4 margaritas. Not too shabby!\n\nAlso, word to the wise: it's seat yourself mostly, so save yourself the awkward moment of coming in and standing there, looking like a shlub.

They were all beautiful brunettes. (Not complaining about their beauty AT ALL!). However, their service skills were poor.\nAfter being seated, we started off by ordering 2 bowls of Edemame, while we looked at the sushi menu. \nWhen the waitress came back empty handed, we ordered our sushi rolls.\nAbout 20-30 minutes later, we received ONE bowl of Edamame and reminded our server of the 2nd bowl ordered. Another 20-30 minutes later, we received the sushi all on one plate. I realize that many sushi bars do this (My pet peeve), however, when you are sitting at a long table, it makes it near impossible to reach across with chopsticks to eat and have to pass or share the plate. Since we did not receive any soy sauce, ginger or wasabi with our sushi,  we had to ask for it....and wait for it!!\n10 minutes later, we had to ask for the condiments again.\nAnother 10 minutes later and still no condiments, someone at our table went in and got it themselves.\nAfter several more minutes, one of the cloned brunettes came over and slapped some soy sauce in front of one of our guests who was NOT eating  sushi at all. He asked,\n  \Whats this?\"", but she just turned and left the table.\n  Again we had to ask about our 2nd bowl of Edamame and were continually promised they would bring it to our table.\n  Toward the end of the meal, the server brought us our bill along with the 2nd order of edamame, as if it were our dessert!! \n  To top it off, the server included a 20% gratuity.

4184,2018-03-04 23:12:58,"Did I have fun? YES! However, keep in mind that my best friend from Tampa was visiting me, and I hadn't seen her in 3 months, so we took it upon ourselves to have an amazing night. This place has such potential - the decor is kind of cool, and I like that the outside porch flows through to the inside area. It's light (so you can actually see well enough), and the DJ booth is raised.\n\nWe 100% enjoyed the music, but it was basically like listening to Sirius Satellite Radio....come on, I can listen to this at home. He didn't really appear to be adding any value or creativity (I am not a DJ pro, but I don't think he was really doing anything other than making a playlist on a Mac, which I am also capable of...maybe I could get hired as their DJ?). When we requested a song, he quipped \I already played that.\"" \""Uh, sorry buddy, we've been here since 9:00pm, and no you haven't.\"" Whatever, incompetent DJ.\n\nNow, the best aspect of this place is the people watching. I wasn't aware that tennis skirts were still in style....and especially not on 40 year old women. I thought the \""beautiful people\"" came here? Not so much on the night we were there. It was an odd hodge podge of men, some older and some younger, women trying to act younger than they are....and a weirdo that loved to dance alone and did not appear to be there with any friends. He really did love to dance, twirl and bust a move, though, which was rather entertaining.\n\nWould I come here again? Probably just to laugh and have a good time....the music is louder than you can get at home, and you don't have to think of the latest cheesy hit, which is sort of nice. The drinks are expensive, though (and not really very good), and the clientele is weird (at least when we were there). They do have cool platform benches for dancing, which are amusing. Overall, this is a fun place every once in a while....like when a friend comes to town. Its strip mall location is also very odd, but extremely convenient for parking and accessibility.""",sXQXqJdR,3849

4193,2018-02-07 13:19:20,"By the time I ate here, I was totally cynical of all Scottsdale restaurants and was really thinking about having my lunch at In-N-Out.  \n\nI got off to a really bad start at this place, too, they made me wait for a table at this half empty restaurant.  Which was okay, I guess, because D. Frank Designs is across the street.   Anyway, I come back, the sweet little hostess girl has my table ready, but the poor girl is limping because she fell at home the night before and hurt her knee!!  She even shows me the damage!  So, I guess it's okay that I had to wait a bit.  I mean the poor working girl is maimed!!!\n\nSo, wouldn't you know, she sits me in front of a window and it's hot as blazes there.  Geez.  So, I complain to my delightful servers Byran and Melia.  Yes, I get two servers.  I think they can easily identify a tough customer at this joint.  I quickly identified them as Mutt & Jeff.  So, Byran says he will tamper with my ventilation and I think, ya right.  But right away, it gets cooler and so do I.  \n\nAnyway, this place has \Republic of Tea\"" tea.  You can't go wrong with any establishment that serves Republic of Tea.  I'm getting stoked now.  So, anyway, I check out the menu and can't decide what I want.  I mean, I'm starving, but I'm not that hungry.  Bryan convinces me to try the Stetson.  He says that if I don't love it, he will take it back and get me something else.  He says that no one has ever sent back the salad.  That's a challenge I can't pass up on.  So, I've finally made up my mind and then that wonderful Melia  comes out with some incredible hummus, fresh chopped salsa and spinach tortillas to tide me over until my salad come.  The flavors were so amazing together!  So fresh and delicious!\n\nNext comes my Stetson Salad.  I don't need to describe it, because every yelp-er before me has done an excellent job.  But you don't know how really amazing this salad is until you try one yourself.  It is so incredibly good.  It's the first and only time that I have ever finished any salad anywhere.  It was so amazing.\n\nAnyway, the sad part for me was that this was my last meal in Scottsdale.  And it was just lunch.  I wish I would have eaten here sooner and I wish I could have experienced dinner.  I will be back.  And Cowboy Ciao will be my first stop next time.\n\nOne of the things that I think sets this place apart, (besides the interesting food),  is the incredible service.  I felt like I was visiting Bryan's and Melia's and they were there to take care of me.  It's a very friendly place, I love that!!""",Zlx2K4lV,1927

We both loved the salad, especially the roasted garlic vegetable dressing. The steak was cooked to perfection, mashed potatoes were excellent, I actually enjoyed the steamed vegetables. The chicken was alright, since the wife does not like mushrooms, we asked to use a different sauce. I would have loved to try it with the original mushroom sauce!!! Overall we had a different experience we normally do not have, we enjoyed it very much. I am glad my wife had a great time, I knew I was taking a chance but it was worth it. Thanks Razz!

That's the feeling I had yesterday afternoon when I foolishly decided to try La Tolteca for the first time...\n\nWhy was this a foolish decision? Because I got sick. Super duper sick. Which I should have known was going to happen because the Fish Burro I ordered tasted terrible. And now, here I am, 24 hours later, still trying to keep fluids in my body in between trips to the bathroom.\n\nNow I know what you're thinking... \What does he expect? He ordered a Fish Burro!\"" And I know. You're right. It's just that I've had such good luck with fish tacos at a couple of other restaurants lately (Canteen, Tacos Atoyac) that I decided to see what sort of magic La Tolteca could create with their mahi mahi. Apparently their in-house magician has Mondays off.\n\nI seriously don't know why there's so many four and five star reviews of this place on Yelp. It's not that great. Even if my burrito hadn't made me ill, I still would have felt compelled to write something to balance all the positive reviews on here. Maybe the corn tortillas they use on their tacos deserve the accolades that other reviewers can't seem to stop talk about, but my flour tortilla was below average. It was dry and it tasted like paper.\n\nAs for the burro, I specifically asked about the filling prior to ordering it and I was told that it only contained cabbage, fresco cheese and guacamole. Sadly, when I took my first bite, out spewed a white, mayonnaise-like substance. The burro's filling was more like a fish salad of sorts and it tasted off. Very off. And the fish wasn't hot. Actually, nothing it the burro was the least bit warm. And the guacamole was on the side--not inside the burro. But again, I was starving at this point so I took it down. Every last bite.\n\nI knew immediately that something was wrong. I considered removing the food from my body as soon as I got outside, but I decided to keep my finger out of mouth and let things settle. Big mistake. There would be no settling. I consider myself to have an iron gut, too. I can basically eat anything in any quantity (not that I do this often) but normally I have good luck. I haven't been this sick since eating food from a middle-of-nowhere farmstand while bike touring in the Caribbean.\n\nI'm giving La Tolteca two stars because I did like their hot sauces--all of them. And they have cheap beer, too ($2 Coronas all day, every day). However, as Michael S. noted in an earlier review, everything I tried tasted off. Tangy is fine when that's what a place is going for, but everything I ate tasted slightly tangy in a ugh-this-is-going-to-make-me-sick sort of way. Not cool.\n\nSo that's that. I really don't think I'll be back. I have no desire to explore the bakery case and there's way too many small taquerias around to take any more chances with this high-volume, supermarket of a restaurant.""",ojJfuqnV,743

Based on other reviews, we ordered the Sauteed Shishito Peppers, which truly made every bite a surprise, and we almost licked the platter clean.  The Roasted Brussels Sprouts with Bacon were amazing as well.  And just when we thought we'd had enough....we had to try dessert!   Mom's Honey Pecan Square was a hit....but my favorite was the pink grapefruit mint sorbet!  A perfect ending to a perfect meal!  When we were leaving, the host asked about our experience and engaged in some delightful banter, which just completed the night.  Next year, we just might start our Scottsdale vacation at Rancho Pinot!""",AegJkWzR,1455
4225,2018-02-09 12:25:25,"In the mood for a burger last night, but not willing to settle for Yak-in-the-Box, Hubby suggested this place, to which he had been once before with a co-worker. It's a casual, dive-y sort of place, which I like. There were a lot of different types of people there- firemen, loners, business men and women... It's got a huge interior, some cool copper topped tables, and some seizure inducing lights (far too blinky for an exhausted grumpy me). \n\nYou order your food at a small window once you have mooed your way through an amusement park-like railing system (albeit a short one) and you specify a burger (or from a short list of other menu items), and your options are bun type and cheese type. At no point did I get asked to what charness I want my ground cow. Hence, I ate puck on a bun. Next time, I'll ask for medium. A third pound burger was plenty (they have half pounders, too), and the bacon comes in circles (which is cool- bacon in every bite is never a bad thing!).  We also had the 1/2 mushrooms 1/2 zucchini side, which was ok. We've had better and worse of both. The topping bar was ok- your usual suspects together with the requisite peppers to make your experience  \southwestern.\""""",f4cFhfH6,3682
4226,2018-06-08 17:44:06,"This was the fourth time I dined at The Rokerij in Phoenix,  the first two times I had a $100 gift card which neatly paid for two people, the third time the VP of my company treated and tonight a friend bought me a birthday dinner, so I have yet to pay to dine here.\n\nRegardless of where you are in the world, The Rokerij is unique and a treat.  First off, there are VERY few restaurants west of the Mississippi that have basements.  The Rokerij's is a great place to mingle with friends.  Upstairs is a dark and friendly atmosphere that is thick with pecan smoke from the kitchen.  It is a small place with limited seating.  And the lines to snag those seats is long 7 days a week.  People who dine at The Rokerij tend to linger for hours so don't expect a rapid turnover.  And reservations are only accepted for parties of 4 or more.\n\nI have seriously had THE best steaks I have ever had in my life at The Rokerij.  They broil them right in front of the bar patrons and honestly there is probably only a handful of places in America where steaks are done to such perfection.  Perfection is not cheap, and no guest should reasonably expect to get out the door for less than $50 per person, but more likely $75 or more.  Is it worth it?  Yes!\n\nTonight, being my birthday, I chose what I had a taste for and that was a Crab Louie salad.  I read some reviews and they agreed that the Crab Louie at The Rojerij is the best in Phoenix.  Several said it was much too large for one person.  So we pre-agreed that we would split the salad and order a couple of \small plates\"", which are equivalent to appetizers, but a bit more exotic.\n\nWhen I heard how big the Crab Louie was I expected to get mounds of lettuce with the usual toppings in modest quantity.  The opposite was true.  The amount of lettuce was about what you would expect in a small dinner salad at Denny's, but it was HEAPED with real crab, many of the pieces being very chunky, and a generous amount of tomatoes, cucumbers, hard-boiled egg and avocados.  It was served with a Louie dressing and a Roquefort dressing.  I have had a taste for an awesome Crab Louie for about 6 months and being my birthday I felt I finally deserved it.  This one was amazing.  Bear in mind it was $20, which is extremely expensive for a salad, but split two ways it was just right.\n\nTo accompany the salad we ordered two appetizers.  One, a smoked sausage with caramelized onion was the perfect complement to the salad.  The other, bacon wrapped shrimp, was insanely good.  The bacon was crispy and tasty and the shrimp was tender and perfect.\n\nI had heard that The Rokerij is known for their Bloody Mary's and we both had one.  No disappointment.  They were tall, full and spicy.  They were served with a beer chaser of Sam Adams (?!?!?) all for $7.  No argument there.\n\nThe amount of food between splitting the salad and appetizers was perfect.  We both ate everything and were pleasantly full.  That is until the waitress mentioned the dessert menu, which included Cr\u00e8me Brulee.  This was a \""must do\"" so we split it.  What can I say?  Sinfull?  Covered with very fresh berries, the caramel topping was torched to a smoky perfection.  I could eat one of these for breakfast every day of my life.\n\nNeedless to say the atmosphere at The Rokerij is unique and as far from a \""chain restaurant\"" as you can get.   I have always found the service head and shoulders above nearly any restaurant I have ever been to.  From the warm greeting at the door, to the waitress, to the very engaged busser to the (I'm guessing manager on duty) who came over to our table just after the bill was paid to very warmly thank us and shake both of our hands.\n\nThe Rojerij is THE place in Phoenix to enjoy the best of the best in food, one of the best dining environments in the country, and be made to feel as if you are close as family as to those in charge.  Don't be turned off by having to wait an hour or more and then ending up sitting at the bar.  If you really need to get your food faster, may I suggest McDonalds or Burger King?  In the end you get what you deserve to get if you know what to expect.""",7qdw0pES,4737

Even though I had leftover hummus from Switch from the night before, I was not to be deterred from trying a new source relatively close to home (especially since Pita Jungle doesn't seem to want to open up in my lifetime, although the rumor is any day now). \n\nSure enough at lunchtime, the place was not too crowded, but did do a solid and steady business. The girl behind the counter was extremely helpful and nice when asking for suggestions. Her's was the chicken shawarma, so off we went!  Of course, the crux of the story was to also get some hummus, which she mentioned didn't come with the sandwich, so I'd have to order separately. No prob, mate, its all good, so of course, let's get a small side.\n\nMy number gets called and the shawarma comes out more like a wrap, and the 'small' hummus was the size of a 12\"" dixie plate - fantastic!!\n\nNet/net - the sandwich was solid and hummus was great.\n\nThe kicker is that its inside the grocery, so you get to do a little shopping for middle eastern coffee, turkish delights, cookies, etc., as a side benefit.""",MoXvwXHT,3637

The pork in the Carne Adovada was nicely seasoned and really tasty...but my scrambled eggs were overcooked and a bit too hard and dry and my potatoes undercooked (so they were a bit soggy).

4272,2018-04-20 13:51:30,"I rarely write reviews, good or bad, but I was so shocked by my experience that I had to share it with fellow Yelppers! I am a Vegan, wether it is by choice or because of food allergies is besides the point in my opinion. Firstly, my mom went in to grab a table and no one had come by the table for drinks even after I had already parked the car, came in and was seated for over 5 minuets. It was not busy so I was not empathetic when it takes over 10 minuets and my moms fianc\u00e9 to get up and ask where our waitress was. \n\nThis is where the drama begins:\nFinally she comes over and at this point we are ready to order, my mom and fiance place theirs and I ask the waitress if there is any way to get the spring rolls without shrimp (the menu says shrimp with vegetables) and she responds \they don't come with shrimp.\"" So, I point it out on the menu, tell her I am a vegan and she replies \""it doesn't come with shrimp, I don't know why the menu would said that, its just vegetables and stuff.\"" I ask her to double check for me. She grabs our menus and walks away. later comes back with the drinks and a menu and says, \""I can't guarantee they don't come with shrimp so here is a menu.\"" I really wanted spring rolls so I ask her to ask the manager or chef if they can make them without shrimp. She comes back and tells me they are pre-made and I cant make any special requests. I say I am surprised they pre-make their spring rolls but that I will take a cucumber salad and a cucumber roll no mayo please. (mayo is commonly put on sushi)\n\nThen the manager comes over. (I did not ask to see a manager) and he tells me the mix is pre-made and it would take to long to make the spring rolls fresh and that they can't make me spring rolls without shrimp. (Are you kidding me, TOO LONG. they are making rainbow rolls back there and deep frying tempura) I tell him that I am simply vegan and ask what would he recommend. he says the vegetable roll. I order that with no mayo and he doesn't even apologize that he can't accommodate me and just walks away.  \n\nShe brings out my cucumber salad, I take a bite and notice it has imitation crab in it, which is cod fish normally. Now, I don't even complain or tell them to take it back I just offer it to my mother, But I am surprised because right before I ordered it, I said I was vegan so here is STRICK TWO this waitress doesn't know the menu items and what is in them. I am not high maintenance at all, I didn't complain, send it back, or ask for it to be taken off my bill.  \n\nLater they bring out my rolls and there appears to be mayo on the vegetable roll. Now forgive me for being worried and not trusting of the competence of the people working here, I ask the waitress if this looks like mayo (I point it out) and she looks at it and says to me, thats kinda green, it is avocado. so I look again and I am still not sure but I just say ok and she walks away. I could not believe she didn't take it to the chef to be sure, and was completely rude and short about it. For all she knows I am allergic to eggs and shell fish, and if I took what she said at face value and didn't challenge her, (the shrimp or mayo) I would have taken a bite of a spring roll that would put me in shock and Id have to be rushed to the hospital (If you know about shell fish allergies, its as bad as peanut allergies) and a rash from the allergy to eggs. (mayo is made of egg whites) lucky for them I have no allergy to cod fish and I didn't complain about it in my cucumber salad either. \n\nNow what makes this worse is I went to Loco Patron earlier that afternoon for lunch and to me that is just a super casual sports bar that serves mexican food (they also have mac n cheese and fries) They were way more accommodating, far less rude and made me the most amazing mexican vegan plate I've had since becoming a vegan, $8 too so cheap!! They even accidently brought me a side of beans with cheese, took it back and took it off my bill. I didn't ask for that, I was just polite and they were sorry about the mistake.)\n\nI have family in Scottsdale, grew up in Scottsdale and worked at local restaurants, Zipps, Oregano's, NYPD Pizza, to name a few. I am not some stuck up bitch whos daddy pays for everything and complain when nothing is wrong. I worked in the restaurant business and know that this was ridiculous and I could not believe this waitress knew nothing about the menu and the manager was such a chump. I have lived in Los Angeles for the last 5 years, and I know veganism is more common over there but this was just ridiculous.\n\nI will never go there again, my family will never go there again and none of us will recommend going there. They were just plain rude. and who wants to eat pre made food at a sit down restaurant. at least Jack in the Box doesn't make it till you order it. WTF.""",h9acjska,4261

My experience here was probably the best sit down restaurant experience I've had in Phoenix!  My friend decided to get a Groupon to FuFu after I saw the good reviews on Yelp.  Caribbean AND African Cuisine?? SOLD!  I'm a Caribbean girl so I'm harder on Caribbean restaurants than any other type cuisine (You betta come correct!) and my experience in Phoenix with Caribbean restaurants has been sub-par!  My best friend is Nigerian,  so she checked out the place online and gave me the ok based on the pics, lol.  I loved learning about the owner's history: combining her African heritage with her experiences in Jamaica.\n\nWe arrived on a quiet Friday night.  I was worried about getting there so close to closing, but Esther (the owner) assured us it was ok to come.  Since I'm a vegetarian, I was concerned about what I would order when I arrived, but I decided to just go with it!  Esther suggested I get the Yassa with white rice and black eyed peas.  My friend got the Curry Chicken.  I was shocked at how good the Yassa was!  No tofu, nothing, just the Yassa sauce with the onions and peppers.  It was SO good.  I also ordered the Ginger Mint to drink and lots of plantains.  The plantains were so cheap- yay!  We ended the meal with the Brownie Cake & Ice Cream.  It was oh so good!\n\nThe African music videos they were playing were hot; we were dancing in our seats!  It was so cute how her hubby kept changing the videos once he saw how much we liked the music.  Esther explained that she was going to be having more social events to bring some \flava\"" to Phoenix (please do!) and invited us to an upcoming party.  Unfortunately it was around finals so we couldn't go.  \n\nI wish FuFu werent so far, but it really is worth the trip.  Great food, ambiance & service!  We plan on going back soon!!! :)""",e1MW1WLt,3163

I've eaten here twice:  once to go, and once dine-in - both for lunch.  \n\nI was very busy the first time so I took back some Kung Pao.  It was pretty good, but possibly the least spicy I've ever had.\n\nThe second time I went with 3 other coworkers that same week because I wanted to give some appetizers and other dishes a try.  We ordered the chicken lettuce wrap (aka \Sugar Cane Chicken\"") for appetizers, tried the hot & sour soup, and ordered the Beef Pad Kee Mow.  \n\nThe chicken lettuce wraps were very good and also fun to make.  They bring in a miniature grill with flames and all, where you can warm your chicken, before putting it in the lettuce, mint, noodles, cucumber and cilantro.  Very tasty too!\n\nThe soup was nothing to write home about, but I didn't really expect it to be.   The Pad Kee Mow was actually very good.  I ordered it spicy, and again was surprised at how little spice was in it.  It was great but could have been more spicy.  They need to utilize a different rating system: Medium, Spicy, and Extra Spicy.  I go to Thai places in OC where the \""medium\"" spice blows away Tottie's \""spicy.\""  This doesn't mean I didn't like it, it's just that I love the spice, baby.\n\nI highly recommend going here for lunch.""",u6vTMbmX,3220

Also ordered the Taro Boba (without ice) which was fine , a tad on the sweet side for my taste but to each his/her own.\n\nThe Hainan chicken was however just horrible. The chicken was definitely semi rancid and both the rice and chicken were soaking in oil.

We walked in and were informed that there was a 30 minute wait for a table in the \dining room\"" but that we could opt to sit in the bar area.  So we did the latter.

Sub-par.  \n\nI had the steak spinach salad, which was described as \""fresh baby greens with gorgonzola, walnuts, tomatoes and red onion tossed in a balsamic vinegarette\"".  The red onion overwhelmed the salad.  The tomato was mealy.  There was hardly any gorgonzola, and the walnuts were nonexistant.  I was bombarded with soggy croutons.  Rock Bottom is just not the place to spend money on food.  It's a bar with a handful of unique beers.

We were a group of five and since there was an hour wait for a table, we opted to sit at the bar.  \n\nFood:\nI didn't have time to peruse the menu since I was too busy chatting, so I chose the first thing that caught my eye - the New Wave Pad Thai ($13.99).  The other gals ordered the Korean Sizzling Salmon ($14.99), Thai Mussel Bowl ($11.99), Spicy Ahi Tuna Tempura Roll ($9.99), and the same Pad Thai dish. \n\nI was pleasantly surprised by the generous portion of my New Wave Pad Thai; it was enough to feed at least two as a full meal.  There were plenty of chicken breast chunks and shrimp.  The sauce was a bit on the tart side, and although not a groundbreaking dish, I enjoyed the flavor. (See pics.)\n\nThe portions for the Spicy Ahi Tuna Tempura Roll and Thai Mussel Bowl were also generous.  I tried a piece of the sushi roll and was not impressed; the \tempura\"" was too crunchy, probably a result of being over-fried.  \n\nDrinks:\nFour of us tried the Forbidden Dragon (looks like a Mojito / $7.99) and the other tried the Frozen Thai Mai (not Mai Thai, mind you / $7.99).  The Forbidden Dragon consisted of pineapple rum, mint, lime juice, pineapple juice, and was served with a floater (shot) of absinthe.  My drink wasn't strong enough for my taste, but still, I liked the flavor - had a hint of licorice (from the absinthe). \n\nPros:\n- quick and attentive service by bar staff\n- generous food portions at reasonable prices\n- interesting menu with lots of choices\n- located downstairs from Airia Nightclub \n\nCons:\n- lack of ambiance (too bright and smoke/noise from the casino floor filtered in through the open spaces where windows should have been)\n- not enough alcohol in the specialty drinks""",1pb0LjDZ,3023

They're willing to seek answers from the chef when necessary and I'm always impressed by that service.\n\nThe presentation of the food is beautiful.  I have a sick love of tea pots and these little things always add an extra point or two in my mind.\n\nI'm not a fan of fish, but my love of the veggie roll is unabated; that's as far as these adventures will take me.  The cucumber rolls at Kabuki are lovely, and the teriyaki steak is worthy of multiple return trips.\n\nFor lunch and dinner, combo plates are available and you're able to pick two or three items off of a menu.  Generally I go with a mixture of teriyaki steak and gyoza, though I've been known to deviate a bit.

4317,2018-05-04 11:47:08,"Filmbar is fantastic conceptually. I've been wanting to actually open one up since I was in high school. As far as I got was to host movie nights at my house or apartment and invite groups of people. I even ran one biweekly  for yelpers and friends a few years back and showed indie and foreign movies. \n\nSo the discovery of filmbar truly piqued my interest. Upon arrival, we were both impressed and confused. We didn't know what we were supposed to do at first and it was a little awkward. If it wasn't for the owner coming out to talk to us, we would've felt uncomfortable the entire time we were there - like uninvited guests at someone's private hipster house party.\n\nThis isn't just a bar... it's a bar that has a movie theater in it. It would've made a huge difference to have someone who works there to welcome people in and tell them \how it works\"" or something. Make that happen, filmbar. \n\nThe decor is classy and refined. The layout is intimate. If you're with a group of people, be prepared to split up into smaller clusters. The atmosphere is dark and cozy. The theater itself is a decent size - larger than home theater and smaller than a screening room. It appears as though they just have some speakers up and a screen and a projector hooked up to a DVD player. \n\nThe seats are somewhat comfy, but put together cheaply... In a few months, I predict they will start looking kinda beat up... in a year, they will need to be replaced. My biggest gripe is that the acoustics and layout of the theater make it too easy to hear drunk people talking to each other over your shoulder. Also - no cup holders for your wine glasses. Disaster is looming nightly. \n\nWe saw Spike and Mike's Twisted Animation... number 50? I saw the very first one that played here in Tempe ages ago. Didn't the internet and youtube render this pointless?

4337,2018-01-22 10:34:24,"If you read my profile, you'd see that I anticipate my last meal being some type of pizza. If I have the option, you can bet it will be from Papa Murphy's!\n\nIf you're not familiar with Papa Murphy's, they are a \take and bake\"" pizza place, meaning that you get your pizza prepared at the shop, take it home, and bake it yourself. This helps drive down the extra costs you incur when you order delivery.\n\nThe pizzas themselves are FANTASTIC! They have several different styles of crust from which you can choose: Thin, Hand-Tossed, or Stuffed. The first two types are pretty self-explanatory. But the \""Stuffed\"" pizza is a completely different beast. It's essentially a pizza within a pizza. I can only confirm that it looks incredible...I'd never be brave enough to actually try it. I'm afraid I might have a heart attack after the first bite!\n\nThe pizza with which I am the MOST familiar is the Chicken Bacon Artichoke. It comes on a thin crust, and it's absolutely LOADED with the aforementioned toppings. We, being a family of three, usually opt for the Family Size pizza. Though, sometimes it feels like that might be a bit much...but it's just so good! \n\nNow, this location is newly opened. Of course, the facility is in immaculate condition. My initial fear was that the new location meant new employees. But, it appears that they may have imported experienced people from different locations. Upon entering, every person in the joint greeted me. Each employee was well-versed in their craft, as every pizza they made while I was there looked AMAZING! There were even a couple of the employees in the background showing off their pizza-crust-spinning abilities! (MAN I wish I could do that!)\n\nNow, the thing that sets this place apart, for me, is what happens AFTER they finish making your pizza. They wrap the pizza, and they always double-check to make sure you know how to prepare the dish when you get home...after all, not everybody is a pizza lush like me!!! After they're sure you know what you're doing, they walk your pizza around the counter, hand it to you, and then they hold the door open for you!!! I know it doesn't seem like THAT big of a gesture, but when you're trying to hold a man-hole-cover sized pizza in one hand, and a three year old in the other, that gesture makes all the difference in the world!\n\nI've been to Papa Murphy's all across the country. Before this location opened up, the closest one to me was the one on Union Hills. Now that this location has opened up on Greenway, I fear for my waistline. I am certain to have to double up on those self-control exercises...otherwise, this place WILL be the last meal I eat!""",8iCa2Qlu,603
4338,2018-04-09 22:25:06,"I was supposed to meet friends for margaritas at Macayo's about a year ago... but we couldn't find parking on a Friday night. Tonight, when my roomie said she was up for Mexican, I couldn't even remember what the place was called, just where it was located and that I had been meaning to try it for quite some time.\n\nThe decor of Macayo's is bright and colorful. With all the porcelain looking animals, including a large number of birds and frogs it felt almost Caribbean. While it didn't feel upscale, this is far from a hole in the wall place. Macayo's is relatively large, which explains why I had a parking problem a year ago. This time around (about 8 p.m. on a Wednesday) parking was no problem. The restaurant wasn't completely dead, just relatively quiet. \n\nWhen dining at a Mexican restaurant for the first time, I stick to the basics. For starters, I wasn't impressed by the salsa and chips. The salsa, although seeming homemade, was fairly standard restaurant style... and heavy on the cilantro. It wasn't watery or chunky. It wasn't particularly spicy or bland. The chips weren't warm and sorta tasted like they came out of a bag. We also ordered the bean dip for an appetizer. While the bean dip was better than the salsa, it still wasn't very impressive. The \creamy\"" refried beans bordered on watery and most of the dip tasted bland until you hit a jalapeo or cilantro leaf. \n\nFor the main course, I ordered the Sonoran Enchilada Sampler, which includes a beef enchilada with green chile sauce, a chicken enchilada with Baja sauce and a cheese enchilada in red sauce with black beans and rice. This was the highlight of the meal. The rice was excellent. The cheese enchilada had a little bit of zing to it which was a nice surprise after the salsa and bean dip. The chicken enchilada, in addition to the green chile sauce was covered in a spicy jack cheese that complimented the chicken. The beef enchilada... is sitting in my fridge, as the portions are rather large (standard for most Mexican resturants in the area).\n\nI found picking a star rating for Macayo's difficult. I usually reserve three stars for restaurants to which, while I would return, didn't have many other redeeming qualities. On the other hand, I usually reserve four stars for restaurants that, while they have great food, still have flaws. In other words, I'd give Macayo's a 3.5 stars if it were an option. There are definitely other things on the menu that caught my eye... and due to the location, I'll probably eventually end up back at Macayo's meeting people for margaritas.""",3tC9gGGL,484

However,  you need to get there fast, and get home just as quick, to get it in your pie-hole before it turns into a pumpkin.  \n\nFor, as everyone familiar with the Thermodynamics of Pizza knows, the thin units cool fast and sublimate from a combination of different states of matter: crispy good crust. hot liquid sauce and piping plasma cheese into one solid block of cool 'za.  The moment is lost like a melted snowflake.  You should really be prepared to wish upon that shooting star as you drive home.\n\nAnyway, try the Frescolina.  It's a classic from Naples with tomato, mozzarella, prosciutto, and arugula.  It is wonderful.  You know, it's like eating a pizza with a salad on it.  \n\nFollowing the antiquated \Dad-logic\"", you can tell yourself that the healthy salad negates the ill-effects of the fatty, carby 'za.  Really, this pizza is not greasy or fatty, and the crust is thin enough that the carbs are quite limited compared to the standard American faire.  \n\nIt is really, really good gourmet pizza.

The car wash guys are great but are not part of Fry's. 3 places to get cheese spread throughout the store and they don't even have Cotija.

Next time I think we will spend more time at the hotel and less time at Westgate. \n\nNot sure what convention was going on, but there wasn't a person there under age of 65.  We didn't mind because we knew they wouldn't be causing a \ruckus\"" all night.  We were the youngsters there even in our mid 40's. \n\nBeautiful hotel, large hallways, room was nice with comfy beds. In fact so comfy, hubby and I slept in separate beds!

Players have said that this is one of those arenas where the crowd definitely becomes the X Factor because the volume on the court can get more intimidating than some other Arenas.  As it should be.  \n\nI've seen lots of other concerts/events here too over the years and it can go from feeling like a small casual place, like during the AND1 Basketball Tour to an upscale \adult\"" spot, when Billy Joel played it, to a rocking explosion - Melissa Etheridge rocking the place down.  This place does a great job of just \""matching\"" the appropriate mood of the night.  \n\nWhile the food stuffs are generally open for the Sports events, there are some nice options. The Copper Club has some nicer options, though still quite casual.  There is a new wood fired pizza place that is actually really good.  Of course you've got Subway, McDonald's and Cold stone too.  \n\nIt's a great spot for any event.  Personal opinion though - if you are going for a sport event you have to sit in the bottom 1/2.  There is such a huge difference in the seating that it's absolutely worth it - even if you're in the last row on the level.""",B4yYSiJx,4432
4422,2018-05-22 01:37:30,"Went here for a girlfriend's wedding shower last Fall and it was really good. The food was excellent, the wine pairings were great and the atmosphere on the patio was just perfect for a gorgeous November evening. It was pretty cool out, but the heaters were nice and toasty and we didn't feel a chill at all.\n\nWe had several kinds of pizza, salads and antipasto plates. The pizza was good, but it is not hearty. I wouldn't have it as a meal; it is more like an appetizer pizza. The salads were good, but the antipasto is what was the real highlight. You see, I am Sicilian and was raised with authentic Sicilian fare, so antipasto is a favorite of mine. Some good crusty bread with olive oil would have made the antipasto platter complete.  If they wanted to really seal the deal, the plate should include pieces of melon, peach and grapes.\n\nSo if it is so good, why is it only 3 stars and not 4? Well, the service was typical Scottsdale. They were nice, but not genuine; friendly, but not warm; gave off the \you should be thankful to be seen here\"" type of vibe.  It seemed that their level of cattiness is in direct porportion to the size of your rear-end.

Big mistake, this meal didn't help my mood.   \n\nThe build your own omelette and bloody mary seemed great on paper.\n\nI didn't even care that I had a waitress-in-training that had absolutely no clue what was going on.  After all, I had time to kill.  I guess taking a piece of paper from a diner to the cook and bartender is difficult labor requiring highly skilled and specialized employees.\n\nBut wait!  The bartender doesn't know how to make a mimosa?  A retarded monkey could make a mimosa.  In between flinging feces on the walls and picking fleas out of its hair.  That, at least, would have been entertaining.\n\nSo I'm going over my omelette choices.  No green bell peppers?  For real?  A \mexican\"" joint with no green bell peppers?  I actually wrote it in, hoping that this was an egregious oversight by the menu-making committee and they did actually have them.  I finished selecting my omelette fixins, including \""chorizo\"".  \n\nI received a plate with a pound of dog food and jalapeno peppers wrapped in an egg.

However, I find that their taps have a lot of \safe\"" beers and for adventurous drinkers, I suggest a trip to Papago Brewing- or my local fave, Phoenix's Lost Leaf (which has them beat on atmosphere,too).

It was bordering on perfect--crispy in all the right places and steaming and soft inside. I love how they serve the syrup warm. The bacon was thick but not too dense. And the freshly squeezed orange juice of course complemented it all. Hard to believe that they don't add any sugar to the juice. I like how the hash browns aren't greasy like what you'd get at IHOP or Denny's. \n\nThe staff are quite friendly and make sure you've been attended to.

OK, we were west of the 17 freeway, so I suppose that counts as \near\"".  In any event, since missing out on the UYE the previous week, I was happy to visit this new-to-me BBQ spot for a very late lunch/early dinner.\n\nWe were seated immediately, and started off with a couple of Blue Moons while perusing the menu.  It was extensive, with almost any type of BBQ combination you can imagine.  I did not take the time to review it all, because I only had eyes for one thing.  Brisket.  To sandwich, or not to sandwich, that was the only question.\n\nWe ended up selecting two BBQ platters - one with smoked BBQ brisket and the other with smoked pulled pork.  Each came with two sides - we chose mac n cheese, pecan cole slaw and potato salad.  Hey, wait, that is only three sides.  That is because we got two, count 'em TWO orders of mac & cheese.  Enable my bad habits!\n\nLook!  Corn bread!  Warm, moist and topped with a healthy ball of butter.  It was probably a good thing we were only given two pieces.  I could have eaten a LOT of that...\n\nOur meals arrived quickly, along with a carafe of spicy BBQ sauce (that went very well on the mac n cheese, I might add).  While the portion sizes weren't huge, they were still impressive.  It was immediately obvious that my friend liked my brisket better than the pulled pork.  How did I know this?  1) because it was OhSoVery good and 2) It was quickly disappearing from my plate without any effort from me!  Of the sides, of course I liked the mac n cheese the most - while it was not the oh so decadent Fleming's version, or the gooey cheesy version from Scottsdale BBQ, it still hit the spot.  \n\n* We did make one strategic error.

4481,2018-05-04 02:13:25,"Let me just preface this review by saying that it does pain me to write a negative review about almost any establishment in the valley.  Unfortunately for India Delhi, it has to be done.  Honestly, I have not dined inside this restaurant, my experience is purely from multiple take out orders over the past year.\n\nLiving in Arcadia and loving food as I do, I am lucky in the fact that I do not have to travel far to enjoy ethnic culinary delights that other cultures have to offer.  If your a foodie in the 21st century, Indian food is all over your radar.  India Delhi, found at 54th street and McDowell in Phoenix, fits the bill of almost every other Indian restaurant in the valley. Nice external building, clean looking restaurant and the normal tinctures related to that region of the world.  \n\nAlways friendly and eager to take your order, the young gentleman at the front counter has never let me down in taking care of my to go order. Always checking each container to make sure it has the correct contents, etc.  On the Saturday I am referencing for this review, the young man was not there, but the owner and his wife were. In my opinion, Indian food is not a cheap venture. I always find myself wanting to try a dish as well as getting a staple that I know is going to be solid. When you add in the extra charge for rice(never included), yogurt sauce(not included), etc, the bill for myself and companion always tops $40.  I usually do not gripe as I know the quality will be there and I just love the food, what can I say.\n\nOn this Saturday though, something was different. This was evident from the moment I walked in the door, I could not put my finger on it, but something was just not vibing.  The owners wife(or co owner for all I know) was at the counter and asked if I wanted the buffet. I politely turned it down as I am not a fan of buffet food, especially with Indian cuisine.  I politely turned that down and proceeded to order tandoori chicken, saag paneer, chicken biryani, basmati rice and some naan.  \n\nWhat happened next is not something I will forget soon.  I watched as the owner walked out of the kitchen with the pan in hands and used the spinach for my saag paneer from the buffet.  The owners and my eyes met as he processed that I saw what he was doing.  In that moment, the owner sold and gave up all his culinary credibility. He proceeded to head back to the kitchen to use said items.  \n\nI waited for another fifteen minutes and took my order home.  What did I find? The chicken biryani, the only item I might add not in the buffet, was extremely hot, almost too hot to touch.  The saag paneer was warm at best. The tandoori chicken was a collection of small legs(customary for Indian buffets) and once again, not hot.  I knew what had happened and could not help feeling beyond annoyed with the situation.\n \nNormally, I just deal with what is, I do not ever send food back and especially on to-go orders.  This time was different, I could not let it go.  I called the restaurant and without pause the owner got on, knowing exactly who I was and what the problem was. He put up a fight for around 20 seconds saying that he just used the spinach as a base for the saag paneer and what not, but then finally just apologized and said he would \make it right.\""  \n\nI do not really see myself going back here, but who knows.  This is a good excuse to venture out and try some more of the valleys offerings in this arena.""",L1vGgPUa,1050

In the 10 years I have been gone, Scottsdale has gone through an explosion of commerce from big chain restaurants to little mom + pop shops and boutiques. I was eager to find some good coffee shops, so I hopped on Yelp and found this place ... boy was I disappointed. \n\nFrom the moment I walked into the shop and up to the counter I continually got the feeling that I wasn't welcome in the shop. I walked to the counter, and hung back a bet letting the customer behind me order, while I perused the chalk board menu (a nice touch). After deciding what I wanted to order, I stood in line and noticed the actual record player with a bunch of records representing the last few years indie/college hits (I also dug the record player putting out tunes). I stepped up to order and was not ever spoken too, I politely asked for my order, tipped a dollar, and was at least waiting for a smile or acknowledgement but received none. I then walked away from the counter assuming my order had been placed (I did receive change). \n\nI watched the female barista make my coffee, which she then simply placed on the service counter (again did not announce or gesture that it was my order). I had to assume it was mine because I was the only one waiting. I walked up the counter, asked if it was my order, to which the employee simply nodded her head. I had asked for my drink \to stay/for here\"" but I was given a coffee in a to-go cup, normally I wouldn't even notice this type of mistake however, as per above, I got the feeling I wasn't welcome. \n\nI then sat down to try and do some studying and the moment I sat down and opened a book, the barista began to give me icy glares. I put in some head-phones to listen to a few video lectures and about a minute after I put on the headphones, the barista walked from around the counter and turned up the volume of the speaker system to an abnormally loud level. I noticed that the other 2 customers in the shop were also taken aback by the absurdly loud level of music. At this point I got the hint that I wasn't welcome in the shop, packed up my stuff and left.\n\nI should note I was the only non-white person in the shop, I don't know if it has anything to do with the attitude I was given, but considering the deference I was treated with it is either an unfortunate coincidence or this place really is intolerant of others.\n\n2 stars because despite all the shenanigans my latte was actually pretty good and was 3 dollars, which I thought was acceptable for the quality. Will not return because for 3 dollars there are numerous other places to get an equivalently good drink without the attitude.""",OLOdR9YK,3799

I found the meat and veggies fresh and tasted great both times.\n\nFirst time was so fantastic that we came back the next week to share the goodness with one of our friends.  There was only one worker and he was sitting at one of the tables outside talking with a friend when we walked up.  He followed us in and while we stood at the counter ready to order, began flipping the dining room chairs onto the tables.  We asked if they were still open (after all it was 8:15).  To which he said \yes\"".  Then asked if the store was open to dine in and he said \""yes\"" as he continued flipping up chairs.  If it were earlier in the night, we would have taken his hint and walked out empty handed.\n\nThe chicken in my pita was barely above room temperature and the sauce was glopped in the middle leaving both ends completely dry.  I ate about 2/3 of it and just threw the rest away to avoid the conflict.  Our friend's steak (which was tossed into the very back corner of the grill to heat up) was still cold.  He only ate about 3 bites of it and had to go back out side to try to get his money back.\n\nThe guy argued with him saying \""I made your pita last, so your meat had to be hot.\"" (He also ordered last and the back corner of a griddle doesn't get hot) and \""You should have come and got me right away.\""  The guy refused to give him his money back and when we asked for the corporate office's phone number, he scribbled the phone number to the store on a napkin!\n\nI have an emailed complaint in with the Director of Operations and will post an update once it's all settled.\n\nAvoid eating here at all cost if the larger Latino guy is working!

There was no need to order an appetizer as they sent out the awesome fries: made in duck fat and three different spices along with dipping sauce. I had the A5 Japanese Kobe steak and my GF had the fried chicken. OK, my steak was melt in your mouth make me scream good. One of the top 3 steaks I have ever eaten. \n\nMy GF wanted the chicken, but here is the catch: it is made for two because the whole chicken is fried in duck fat (once again). That was the only bummer, if you want the chicken and no one wants to share with you (hey, I came for the steak), you are stuck. But my other thought is: if you really want something, screw the cost, order it, and take the rest home with you. I had a thigh the next day and it was amazing. Along with the chicken you get a healthy portion of truffled mac and cheese with broccoli. It was pretty damn amazing--especially the gratuitous inclusion of the broccoli. Our server told us later that you can ask for more broc if you want--note to self. \n\nThey also have a great wine selection. Since my GF offered to be the driver, I ordered a half bottle of my favorite pinot noir: Merry Edwards, and that just topped off the night.\n\nAlso, if you are not a fan of truffle oil (crazy, I know. I love the stuff), this is not the place for you. Other than that, we had a great dining experience. Service was great and timely.

It's definitely a sub shop. A place where you can get subs. Are they good? Yes... quite. The food all seems pretty fresh and you can bet it's healthier and of higher quality than the shit they shovel at Subway or the like. Generous with the meat - fresh sliced and priced to move as well.

With days jammed packed this short trip would actually prove to be a little tricky in planning but after getting a general feel for the local logistics the restaurants fell into place nicely with breakfast, lunch, and dinner planned strategically each day along with a few snacks.  Beginning first with breakfast, just as my trip did, there were three proper sit down breakfasts in The Valley and the first took place less than an hour after I hopped of the plane at The Farm at South Mountain.\n\nWith bags packed light and my car easily obtained the drive to Morning Glory Caf\u00e9 would be a straight forward 15 minutes from Sky Harbor Airport and arriving at the large farm I proceeded down the gravel path through gardens of streaming sunlight that I quite simply did not expect to see in the \""desert.\""  With signs delineating the location of the caf\u00e9 (and the oft raved Quiescence next door) parking was found under a shady tree and checking the thermostat, 87 degrees Fahrenheit at 8:45am) I hopped out of the car and walked down the path to the restaurant only to find the patio approximately 1/3 full.  Greeted promptly by a thin young woman and subsequently by the elderly gentleman who would be my server I was told to \""sit anywhere you like.\""\n\nSelecting a seat in the shade as my pale Midwestern complexion certainly was not ready for an hour in the Arizona sun it would be mere moments before Cliff would stop by with the menu and a bucket of condiments to inform me of the daily pastry special and to ask if I had any questions.  Requesting a coffee I was informed that the coffee, water, and tea are all \""help yourself\"" and suggesting I'd need a minute to browse the menu I was told to take my time.  \n\nWith the menu concise but full of excellent choices largely consisting of locally sourced meats and organic produce I spent a few moments weighing my decision and with my choices made I motioned to Cliff who stopped by to take my order and warn me \""you'd better be hungry\"" before departing for the kitchen.  Undeterred by his warning I next proceeded to the coffee stand where biodegradable cups and lids were provided for both water and coffee and after getting a cup of each I returned to my seat where I sipped the thin and mildly acidic locally roasted Caf\u00e9 Cortez coffee while awaiting my appetizer.\n\nPrebaked but still warm, the first item to arrive at my table would be the pastry of the day - a Blueberry Muffin nearly the size of my fist and bespeckled with crystals of cane sugar.  First tasting the muffin as it was and then gilding the proverbial lily with salted California Dairies butter the muffin would prove to be quite impressive in its density but also in its fluffiness as the medium-size blueberries burst with flavor within the buttermilk batter with tinges of cinnamon tickling the palate.\n\nWith coffee refilled and a short wait as the patio filled another pair of tables with locals (and regulars judging by the greeting) Cliff would arrive perhaps twenty minutes after I was seated with the main course - the \""Farm Monte Cristo\"" consisting of two thick slices of fluffy rustic French Toast sandwiched around slow baked local ham, two over easy eggs, and melting cheddar cheese.  Apparently expecting me to be overwhelmed by the size Cliff offered me a \""good luck and bon appetite\"" before stepping away and with that I set out to douse the amalgam with warm organic maple syrup and take a bite; a bite that more or less redefined the Monte Cristo for all time as the bread was not the least bit oily but rather light and fluffy with a nearly croissant textured interior and slight yeasty notes mellowed by the syrup and the powdered sugar. Moving next to the ham-young, fresh, lean, and salty - and then the sharp cheddar and creamy eggs the flavor was in a word \""perfect;\"" salty, sweet, creamy, crunchy, and at the same time surprisingly light.  It was not only the best breakfast item I had in Phoenix, but the best sandwich I've had in a very long time.\n\nWith Cliff returning surprised that I'd finished the meal and offering me a \""good job\"" I joked (well, not really joked as I really did go for pastry and pizza afterward) that the sandwich \""wasn't that big, but it was THAT good\"" and thanking him for the service I requested the tab while getting yet another coffee to enjoy while I checked my mail and another cup to go.  Noting now that the experience of such a great sandwich, setting, and service is not \""cheap\"" ($23 with tax and tip) I can say without a doubt that if I do end up in Phoenix long term Cliff will not make the mistake of underestimating my capacity again because without a doubt I'll be a regular.""",v5TEGRBe,2264

4528,2018-02-13 10:18:24,So after reading some other reviews it looks like this place is total hit and miss. My experience was a total miss! \n\nMy Financee and I went from Sunday brunch and was suprised at how dark it is inside. I guess when I think diner I think bright and clean. There was a waitress shuffling around that looked like she wanted to cut a bithc and one that was hussling for the whole crew. \n\nMy financee got eggs benedict and while the sauce was good everything else was awful and I could only eat 3 bites of my chorizo omelet it was so greasy. \n\nI am tempted to say I will come back and try something else but frankly,xUrlkdw8,595

4530,2018-04-05 00:57:03,"Took Mom and myself to have dinner here after work on Sunday (4/12).  Nice space.  We were given above-average service when we were seated at the robata counter.  (Actually, it's the level of service I expected given the atmosphere of the restaurant.  Anything less would have been suspect.)  When we had to move to the bar in order to take advantage of reverse happy hour, the service level dropped considerably- more on that later.\n\nSince we had arrived around 8:30p, we studied the menus to see what we could try off of the regular sushi options for dinner (the soft-shelled crab) and happily found out that Roka Akor recently started offering, \on a smaller scale,\"" a few robata apps only to be served on Sundays.  I thought what a nice way to be introduced to the robata menu.  I asked the usual questions regarding allergy concerns and asked how certain items were prepared.  I even handed the bartender , Colin, a list of allergens to hand to the chefs.  (Evidently this list was only going to be looked at once, since many of our dishes had to be corrected after delivery.)\n\nOff of the robata apps menu, I ordered the shrimps ($5) for Mom and the zucchini ($1.50) and the black cod ($5) for us to share.  Off of the regular sushi menu, I ordered the soft-shelled crab roll ($9 for 5 pcs.) for Mom.  The timing of delivery of these items was haphazard.  It took at least 10 minutes before the plate containing two medium-sized shrimp to arrive.  To charge $6 for two grilled shrimp is just ridiculous!  It did smell wonderful and looked appetizing, but Mom wasn't wowed by them- certainly not at $3 per shrimp!  The soft-shelled crab arrived about 5 minutes after the shrimp did and looked great.  Mom found the rice good enough, but she still wasn't feeling any love.  The plate of zucchini arrived roughly about 5 minutes after the crab roll (that's 20 minutes after I ordered!) and held 5 pcs. of seasoned zucchini (salt, pepper, and soy) and a dollop of mustard sauce at one corner of the plate.  Mom liked the one piece she tried, but as much as I tried to get her to try the mustard, she didn't, so I can't report on that aspect.  So here we were, 5 minutes before happy hour was to commence, and all I had to nibble on were the zucchini pieces... Black cod was nowhere to be found.  Correction, Colin the bartender said he spied it at the robata counter, but did not make a move to retrieve it.  I asked Colin if I could give him my happy hour menu selections (all cost $5 each) so that he may have them ready for entry at 9p?  He took my order of Crispy squid and a salmon roll.  I also ordered two Roka Akor burgers, one without the housemade bun, and instead asked for an extra slice of heirloom tomato as a sub.  Would you believe that the crispy squid (again, only for Mom to enjoy bec. the batter contained *!) and the salmon roll (which arrived with **, which I wrote down on the list as two of my allergens- apparently the chefs did not remember, nor did Colin recall to alert the chefs) arrived before the black cod app?  Anyway, the salmon roll was left for my Mom to enjoy while the chef prepared another, allergen-free, for me.  Before I go on, let me say that Mom LOVED the calamari!!  This was the first dish that wowed her, and she exclaimed that this version of calamari is the best she's EVER tasted and even begged for me to forget about my allergy and try them- they were that good!  But I stood my ground.  I found the salmon to be very fresh-tasting and mild-flavored.  The pea-sized miso-mayo garnish that sat atop each piece was so mild, the roll could have been served without these embellishments and no one would know the difference.  I'd say that the black cod (3 pcs.) arrived at least 45 minutes since the time of order.  At least.  Aren't robata items, esp. seafood, supposed to be quick to cook?  I will say that the cod tasted superb, and I'd order them again.  Well, maybe.  $5 for three small pieces is too much, I think.\n\nLast, but not least, to arrive were the beef burgers, one-at-a-time.  Funny, the first burger, which arrived without avocado, but with a bun, so that was quickly returned.  My Mom's burger came, with everything on it, but she didnt' try hers until mine arrived- she was still working on the calamari and the salmon roll.  I liked the beef patty, cooked perfectly to medium rare, although I wished there was more flavor.  Mom's burger looked amazing.  Too bad the lighting at the bar was very minimal (one oil lamp for the both of us until Colin saw me taking photos and lit up another and placed it in front of me, but the fire died down soon after).\n\nI hope to return again to see if the service improves (better memory recall and timing of delivery).  I found the ambivalence showed by Colin of the (greater than 30%) tip I'd given him off-putting.  Factored in the price of the comped salmon roll, PLUS tipped based on the burgers original price of $4 each, too.  Hmm... maybe not too soon a return.""",sN82D7TT,4714

It came in two separate medium cooked pieces (pink on the inside and perfectly prepared) and the bone there were probably a good 15-16 oz of meat.  If you're going to enjoy a $45-$50 steak, this is the way to go.\n\nWe paired the steaks with a 2007 Baileyana Grand Firepeak Cuvee, Edna Valley which went down really well and had an excellent flavor.  Two appetizers also were ordered: sauteed asparagus & lobster gnocchi.    Nothing too special about the sauteed asparagus but it was really fresh and well seasoned.  I guess the only way you can mess up asparagus is if you overcook it and that certainly wasn't the case.  Another highlight of the night, almost as special as the bone in fillet, was the lobster gnocchi.  It may give me a heart attack earlier in life but it was that darn good.  The small stringy pieces of lobster was a nice addition to a doughy gnocchi entree.  But this gnocchi restored my faith in the dish because all other gnocchi's I've had have been \bland\"" and very doughy.  It's hard to explain what made this one sooo great but it had a crusty flaky breadcrumb type top to it along with great flavor.\n\nMastro's...you lived up to the expectations and then some, and you better have because it was $260 for the two of us!!!

I couldn't resist.\n\nI also heard a little while back that the Phx location is Dirty Sacks!  Frankly,  it's given me a chance to shout \Who wants dirty Sacks?\"" at work so many times, I don't really care - but this was like a year ago, so hopefully they've gotten a little squeakier!  Honestly, though, I've never seen anything I'd think was really gross around there, or had anything wrong with my sandwiches.\n\nMy love of veggie sandwiches prevails, and so I must give props to Sacks for their Impressionist sandwich - got to love a fresh tasting sandwich (cream cheese, lettuce, cucumber,  tomato, carrot, avocado, red onion, sprouts) with your  choice of 2 kinds of cheeses (in addition to the cream cheese, oh yes)!\n\nOn the meaty side of things, I have thoroughly enjoyed a few different kinds, but I really like the Art Deco (salami, ham, provolone cheese, marinated bell pepper, lettuce, tomato, onion, pepperocini, & italian dressing), or to change it up, the O'Keefe on the rare rainy day (it's a  sandwich of soft chunks of chicken, sauteed mushrooms, swiss cheese, avocado, lettuce, tomato, honey mustard).\n\nI totally appreciate that they have different kinds of bread ( I like the grilled onion dill bread or sun dried tomato basil bread!) & with your sandwich, you always get a delicious chocolate chip cookie!  You can buy the batter to make your own cookies from the eatery too, which is pretty cool.\n\nI've only tried the pasta salad out of the sides, but I dug it - it's a nice little addition to the meal - definitely am interested in trying some of the other sides or soups!\n\nMy favorite thing to do, though, now that I've tried a few things on the menu, is to just go in randomly and see what the daily specials are & pick a sandwich off of that sideboard.  Jeez... I got a sandwich there once, I'm watering at the mouth a little just remembering it.\n\nI think it was called the Michaelangelo (for good reason - oh, and are you seeing a naming trend?  Get it?... *art* of sandwicherie, hurr hurr) - it was on grilled onion dill bread, had chicken, black forest ham, grilled mushrooms & artichoke hearts, melty havarti cheese, fresh spinach, tomato, olives, & I do believe some kind of saucy condiment (what was it?! ahhh!)  Anyway, if this sandwich was available on a regularly scheduled basis, I would be there every time.\n\nPhew, I need a minute to recover from writing that description. Let's see. The staff has always been pleasant to me, and the food is reasonably priced.  I only wish it were open later, or on Sunday as well!\n\nOh well. Sunday is a day of rest.

I was a server for a long time so I get it. \n\nBut the manager walked over and proceeded to interrogate my boyfriend like he was a 15-year old who just snuck into a rated R movie-- just because his ID was a little haggard.

I'm sorry you THINK I'm being rude.\""\n\nAnd then he proceeded to argue with me on whether or not he was being a polite person. I was a server for four years on mill avenue, and I have never, ever treated anyone that way while carding them.

4580,2018-04-24 16:20:38,"I have been to FnB two more times since my initial review. While I still love the unique, veggie-centric dishes, there were a few hiccups from a food and service standpoint that prompted me to update my review.\n\nI took my dad here for his birthday because I knew he would love sitting at the counter in the middle of all the action since he was in the restaurant business as an owner/manager for almost 20 years.\n\nProblem 1- His okra, black eyed pea and bacon dish had to be sent back because the okra was too woody. Very difficult to cut with a fork and knife. The replacement dish was much better. The okra was tender, and the bacon was cooked perfectly (according to my husband).\n\nProblem 2- I ordered a vegetarian plate for my entree as I've done the last two times knowing I would get three portions of veggies chosen by the chef. I was reassured by the server that I wouldn't be getting repeats of any of the dishes that we already ordered as appetizers. That is how it was executed, but my plate was given to another person in our party. It took a awhile to flag down a server to remedy the situation. I tried a bite of the potatoes that were on the plate, and they were pretty bland. Luckily my replacement plate featured 3 great dishes: cold corn salad with basil and peaches, curried eggplant and zucchini, and very fresh green beans in a wonderful tomato sauce.\n\nProblem 3- My sister ordered coffee with dessert, and it came out tepid. Obviously very old coffee. At that point, my dad got a bit annoyed because, as he pointed out, \a restaurant has to at least get the basics right.\""\n\nMy dad did have a great time despite all this so I'm still very happy with FnB. The trick candle on the side of the amazing butterscotch pudding was a hilarious touch.""",o0AgkiNn,2757

Christ Almighty, it was crowded. Both ways we waited for the next train because there was no room on the first one. There was really no room on the second one either, but it was squish or not bother going. I can also see that there will need to be some training of Valley passengers regarding rail etiquette:\n\n1. Give the people getting OFF the cars a freaking second to do so before barrelling in. \n2. Don't sit on the floor of the car. Not only are you more likely to get stepped on (especially if the conductor sucks, and the one on the return trip had a lead foot), but you are also taking up 2-3 times the space of someone standing. \n3. Wear deodorant, people.\n4. There's no need for you to stand on the edge of the platform and crane to see the cars coming. It will not make the Metro Rail come any faster.\n5. Be considerate of others, and maybe not rap loudly about \it's yo' birf-day, so I'm a-gonna kill you,\"" on a crowded rail car. \n\nNow, I do have high hopes for the Metro Rail, and Hubby and I already have plans to use it again this week- but we'll be waiting until the free days are over. Full? I hope it will be. Crazy, chaotic, and dangerous? We hope that will not be the case regularly. There were many people around us who admitted they were riding it with no destination at all, just back and forth, up and down. Wish I had that much free time.""",0SmZnS25,4727

The new owners hire lots of college students with tattoos everywhere as well as lots of piercings.  Seems like tattoos and too many piercings are a job requirement along with disrespect and a lack of desire.  The staff is what made this place the worst restaurant ever and doesnt seem to matter how often you let management know I just dont think they care.  Also in the past few years there is a growing number of homeless that sit out front begging for money.  They sit so close to the outside patio that you have them dining with you or at least it feels that way making you incredibly uncomfortable.  Our last visit we sat on the patio which was next to a bench just outside the restaurant where a few homeless were stationed.  One girl had a huge rat on her shoulder and it was beyond disgusting.  Management obviously doesnt care and does nothing to improve anything so we go way out of our way now to eat at the other Greek in Chandler at Chandler Mall.,sX0RQARP,2275

4598,2018-01-28 21:21:29,"We were referred to Great Spaces through Ikea when we were looking to update our kitchen. Initially, Justin Schmitt was very helpful with ideas and patient with our changes. Then things went wrong.\n\n-A \3-4 day\"" installation dragged out for weeks.\n\n-Our special order faucet was broken during teardown or rebuild; when they couldn't find an exact replacement, they installed a much lesser faucet and gave us a small \""credit\"" off of the balance due. The value of the new faucet + the credit equals about half of what our previous faucet, the one they broke, cost.\n\n-Their plumber damaged the reverse-osmosis filtration system under our sink. We had to call a specialist in to fix it. Great Spaces did, ultimately, credit us for that bill, but only after a hassle. Justin & David actually told us that they did us a favor by not charging us to hook it up in the first place...somehow, a system that hooks up to the water line, and flows water,  doesn't count as the \""plumbing\"" that they quoted reinstalling even though it was in place when Justin quoted doing it.\n\n-They quoted removing our over-range, wall-mounted microwave and installing a provided vent hood in it's place. Aside from adding several days to the job, we had to haggle about the install and the resulting installation left not only a bad drywall patch job, but I had to re-level the hood as it was hung crooked.\n\n-They quoted installing 2 Ikea countertops on our kitchen island and they told us that there would be a small seam down the middle. What they didn't tell us, though, was that the seam would be wavy and uneven and that, worse, the ends of the tops would not match so each end of the island has \""steps\"" sticking out where they don't line up. It looks like a wanna-be handy man's first attempt at a discount home improvement job rather than the professional install we were paying for.  Justin not only told me that this was Ikea's \""Quality Standard\"", and there's nothing more they would do about it, but that he had personally worked it out for us to get a full refund on the counter tops from Ikea. As it turns out, that was just a lie to get us to pay the final installment of their bill. Further, the issue isn't with the counter tops; the issue is with their hack-job installation.\n\nIt's been less than 2 weeks since they \""finished\"" the install that began on May 8th. I've already had to replace 2 of the drawer handles they installed because the screws were stripped out and readjust most of the large pull out drawers to stop rubbing & dragging. If I have any other issues I definitely will not be expecting Great Spaces to resolve them; I don't think they're capable.""",wugo2Sgj,676

Even my Bloody Mary had a slice of crisp bacon in it along with a celery spear, olives and onions. Probably one of the best Bloody Mary's I have had in awhile. \n\nThe location is a little off the beaten path which is why, I think, people are lined up to get in the Breakfast Club a couple of blocks away for mediocre food, and here at Bacon- the food and service is better and there was no line on the Sunday I was there. \n\nI was seated in what they call \the nook\"" located on the side where I had full view of the restaurant. The menu was well organized and entrees come with toast and breakfast potatoes and your choice of a side of bacon or ham. You can also substitute fresh tomatoes if that is your wish. \n\nThe food came up quickly and was delicious! My ham and cheese omelet was perfectly done (all melted cheese and ham inside and firm eggs on the outside) and the side of bacon was crisp and tasty. Given the size, this easily was a 4 egg omelet. Breakfast with drinks ran about $20 which was cheap for all the food I got. \n\nBut I would be remiss if I didn't talk about what really blew me away about this place. It's the fantastic service! Everyone seems to be part of a larger team. I was greeted by one person, seated by another and had at least three servers taking care of me. And countless people stopped by to ask how things were, if I needed more water for my tea, or if I wanted more preserves for my toast. It was unbelievable! While they have been open for 9 months- they had the staff of a place that has been open much longer. \n\nThe ambiance is contemporary but is warmed up by the blue booths, checkered table cloths, and some mismatched dining tables in the center that can be expanded for larger groups. There are also antique food cases lining the walls filled with tins of chocolate, and other food \""cues\"". I also liked that they have those \""roll up\"" doors on the one side that bring the outdoors in and seats outside on those perfect days. \n\nIf I lived in Scottsdale- this would be my \""go to\"" brunch place. What I don't get is why people are waiting in line at a place around the corner that left me a little cold. C'mon people. If you haven't checked Bacon out- you should.

I had about three helpings of that salad so I had my veggie quotient for the week.\n\nHow about those desserts? They had several different pies. And the winner was the coconut pie. How I stopped myself at one piece, I'll never know. Now on to the Gelato, the Mango was good, but to me the show stopper was the Coconut.

You make your decision and the hipster asks you what size. Shit, another decision must be made! Their coffee cups are small as this is not an anti-hipster corporate hangout, aka Starbucks. Wow, you think! Hipsters are so cool they don't even need a super sized venti coffee to feel important. Do you secretly want to become a hipster? No. You have no tattoos and are pretty sure that's the first requirement for being a true hipster.

Maybe two of the three smallish pancakes were  cooked to the point of burnt on one side.. I notice they put that side down...The expensive side of bacon was smallish strips and cool to cold,  Nothing worse than cold bacon...The poached eggs were great.  All in all I wasn't impressed with the quality and delivery of the food and the service borders on atrocious.  I was encouraged as a singleton to sit at the bar because there was a 20 minute wait, yet there were plenty of empty tables as I threaded my way thru the restaurant.  Two on the porch outside the window near where I sat at the smallish bar (3 close stools) were empty the entire 40 minutes or so I was there.. What system to restaurants use anyway to do their seating?  The \lots of empty tables but you still have to wait a long time stuff\"" sucks.\nNot sure I'd go back..

Incandescent lights shone down on your little domestic beer swilling group and the walls were barren of adornment because you were too cheap to go buy some crap posters to put up over the yellowing wall paper, and mom didn't like nail holes in her dry wall.

But it took forever to get the Peach ale as she said they were tapping a new keg, and when we did receive it, the beer tasted flat and lacked the refreshing peach taste that normally accompanies this ale. It was the Peach ale, it was just not as good as previous visits. Maybe new keg? I don't know. One of my CO friends had been to 4Peaks before and said the same thing about this particular batch.\n\nThen my friends ordered the Tap Room Tenderloin- both without onions. They both came with onions. And my favorite thing on the menu- the Portabella Beer Bread had been dramatically altered. Instead of the sauteed onions, mushrooms and tomatoes that used to be in the beer bread, it was carrots and broccoli. I love both of those veggies, but not in this sandwich/wrap. It added a different taste & a crunch (both veggies were in thick, whole pieces) that was not tasty.

4728,2018-03-08 19:53:27,"My family and I moved to Scottsdale over 20 years ago and I have always had a place in my heart for Don & Charlie's.  We used to go there often for birthdays/anniversaries/graduations, etc.  It was my birthday this week and my parents wanted to take me out so I said \Let's go to Don & Charlie's, I haven't been there in I don't know how long\"".  Sadly, after having eaten there I believe that I made a mistake with this suggestion.  The restaurant itself hasn't changed since the last time I was there - it's still got wall-to-wall memorabilia, it still has the same old-school steak house ambiance, but the feeling that I got during and after the meal was really one of a restaurant that is resting upon its laurels and not doing much to deliver a quality product.  My Caesar salad was made with lettuce that was obviously old - it was not wilted, but it was very soft and floppy with no crunch to it whatsoever.  My father ordered the creamy coleslaw which bore a great resemblance to cabbage soup so high was the dressing to cabbage ratio.  My mother greatly enjoyed her house salad with a balsamic dressing but this was mostly because she thought the balsamic was the best that she had had in a long while.  All three of us ordered baby back ribs for dinner - my parents just had the ribs, I had a combo with the ribs and a filet.  All three of us remarked that the ribs were \""passable\"",  the meat was tough and fatty - not at all what I remember in terms of quality from when I used to eat there.  I have honestly had ribs that I found more enjoyable at casual restaurants like TGI Friday's or Ruby Tuesday's.  When you are charging $30 for a rack of ribs, they REALLY need to be better than \""acceptable\"" which was the highest grade I could offer on these.  While ordering our entrees, my mother asked which ribs were more tender and our server informed us that the beef ribs were the most tender, but they had sold out of their entire stock of beef ribs already.  Our reservation was at 6:30 - fairly early in the evening, so my mother's reaction was \""Really?\""  His response - \""Oh yes, they were actually sold out at 5:00 PM.\""  This speaks to a lack of organization and knowledge on the part of management - if you are running out of a popular item by 5 PM on a weekend before proper dinner service even begins then that indicates a serious problem.  My Filet was better than acceptable - it was not as good as I remember, but still very good.  Unfortunately my disappointment in the ribs was such that it overshadowed any feelings I may have had about the steak.  Our server was professional and courteous and I did not notice any of the issues with the hostesses that some others have reported, but I really have to say that I am disappointed in Don & Charlie's.  It's one thing to go back to a place you have a fondness for and find the experience lacking in relation what you remember - we all have a tendency to look at the past with rose-colored glasses I think.  This was a case of going to a place that I have a genuine fondness for and find the experience lacking in relation to what I consider acceptable for any high end restaurant.  I believe my grade of \""Meh. I've experienced better.\"" is completely accurate - I have experienced better at other steak houses, at other casual dining restaurants, even hole-in-the wall eateries where I used plastic utensils to eat my meal.  I say this as someone who has nothing but fond feelings for D&C's - you guys need to improve, because a wall full of signed baseballs and dim lighting will only take you so far.""",nBsgXsV1,1556
4729,2018-04-21 06:41:07,"So now I remember....\n\nI remember why I never make the trip down here on Saturday mornings.\nI remember why the market is more crafts than produce\nI remember why regular grocery stores get my business when I grew up shopping at a public market...\n\nI don't go to Phoenix Farmers Market because there are no farmers there.  The place is over run with ladies who make crafts and a few artists.  There are prepared food vendors selling their not so interesting food at boutique prices.  There were a couple I found interesting enough to consider... the pickle lady, boutique chocolates and Eastern European bakery goods come to mind, but the rest were a waste of my time.\n\nFor any produce market to grow and be successful they have to offer something better than the grocery stores.  That \something better\"" is usually a cheaper price.  It is easier for vendors to do so because they don't have the overhead of a store and all the associated expenses.  Most cities have markets where the vendors pull up their step van, open the back, and literally sell out of the back of the truck.  The Phoenix Market vendors don't seem to be aware of this.  They bring a red wagon of produce out of their yard and display it in little packages.  They think we should all pay extra because they are local.  As long as they charge at least twice as much for their goods as any other store in town, there is no reason for people to buy.... other than the feeling of being charitable.  In my opinion, there are better charities than overpaying to a vendor who feels like the world owes it to them for being local.  Simple laws of supply and demand.  As long as they price is lower elsewhere, they won't have my \""support.\""\n\nThat doesn't mean I don't support local growers.  I can stop at any number of markets and get flowers for half what I saw being charged today. $7 is a little steep for a bunch of wildflowers when I can get a bunch of daffodils for $1.49 at my corner store.  I can buy Hickman's eggs at most local stores for less... and shamrock is local as well.  The one i found particularly insulting was a seedling basil plant for $7 while a huge bushy plant in a 7\"" pot is less than half that at a regular  store.  If I want a seedling plant in a Dixie cup, I can push a seed in some dirt and wait for 3 days too.\n\nNope.... I won't be buying things at the Phoenix market.  I don't need to pay a premium to the vendors for the privilege of finding them all in one place on a Saturday morning.  I will probably do better stopping at the produce stands along 99th ave on my way home from work every now and then, or the trucks that park on the corners on the outer edges of our city""",aaZBedSr,369

4738,2018-04-20 08:09:18,"This place has a cool, retro chic thing going for it as far the interior is concerned but all the loveliness ends there.   First off, the entrance is kind of awkward.  As soon as you walk into the \bistro\"" you are in the middle of the restaurant traffic pathway.  It is a small place and you feel somewhat cramped and there was no host/hostess in sight.  One of the bartenders greeted us and let us pick our spot (there weren't too many options) so we sat by the door.  The bartender took our drink order (which by the way they only serve half bottles of wine but still charge full bottle prices) and then said the waitress would be right over to get our food order.  We perused the menu several times and were still waiting on the waitress to come our way.  She passed by us many times but seemed too concerned with the other tables.  Finally we palce our order after the bartender had to tell her many times that we were ready.  We split a salad and then placed an order of the Buffalo stax and the \""build your own\"" beef stax.  They never asked how we wanted them cooked and to be quite honest it did not dawn on us until we were eating them but mine arrived \""very well done\"" and my boyfriend's arrived raw in the middle and burned on the outside.  Needless to say we were upset but very hungry and ate what we could.  \n\nI think the staff is too preoccupied with keeping a trendy Scottsdale image that they lack quality on the food and service level.  It's quite a shame b/c the location is great and they would have no problem keeping regulars coming to an overpriced burger joint.  I would never go back here again.

Sad to say, this is one restaurant I will not be returning to.\n\nThe food was bland and lacked flavor.  It almost like they ran out of \ALL SPICES\"" right before we ordered (yes including salt and pepper).  To start of we ordered an appetizer, the Papa a la Huancaina, sliced boiled potato served at room temperature covered with a cold, bland, bright boldish yellowish colored hollandaise/mayonnaise sauce. Let's just say it was a start to a bad meal.\n\nFor the main course we ordered the Lomo Saltado, generous chunks of beef sauted with onions, tomatoes, and potatoes which sad-to-say was probably the best dish we had.  The dish was uninspiring, something you could find at a sit-down chain restaurant.   Nothing about the dish screamed Central American flavors.\n\nWe also had the Jalea, a combination of breaded octopus, shrimp, and chunks of fish fillet topped with a Peruvian Salsa (a.k.a. your standard chunky and fresh pico de gallo, (tomatoes, onions, cilantro, and lime juice)). I have never in my life had something that was breaded and deep-fried so soggy in my life!!!  The breading was heavy and disgusting.  It also came with the worst plantains I've ever had.  Dry, overcooked, and extremely chewy.  Put it this way, I've had better plantains at Bahama Breeze then this place (yes I said Bahama Breeze).\n\nI am not trying to pick on this place.  I swear!!!  But when the owner's brother helps you order and tells you what they are known for and what they make best and they miss horribly?  Well, needless to say I can only imagine what there non-staple dishes taste like.\n\nNot to beat up on these nice folks too much.  They place was cute.  The place was painted in a vibrant yellowish/brownish mustard type color, which gave the place a warm and bright feel.  On one wall was a mural of what was to resemble a village in Peru.  The other wall was a collection of trinkets from the native land and of course the flag of Peru.  The servers were extremely nice.  Beware, when you order water, they bring out bottled (and charge you), so if you want tap you need to ask and depending on your Spanish or their lack of English, that may be a challenge.\n \nI hate to say this because the place was quaint and the help was friendly, but if you have a craving for Central American and/or Peruvian food, don't waste your money or time here. I'm just going to wait till the next time I'm back east in NY or DC/Northern VA to get real and tasty Peruvian food and I would suggest you do the same.""",9kHVSc4U,4061

I got the Chicken pot pie (which I admit was gimorous! Was a bit salty but plenty of vegetables and chicken). Kristopher had the Seafood Salad and said it was delicious. Both ended up in leftover boxes to take home since there was so much food.\nTheir New Orlean Beignets are really good, but probably 3,000 calories. They are like doughnut holes served with a side of chocolate, vanilla or strawberry sauce.\n\nWhen I come here to pick up a to-go order, I usually get the Santa Barbara Chicken Sandwich with fries and a salad (which is yummy).

I had their beef noodle soup and my husband had their vegetable and beef fried noodles (lo mein).  Both were very good.  Best noodles I have had in AZ, hands down.  They only make one kind of noodle, but you can choose from a variety of shapes.  \n\nA warning however to those who have an aversion to certain meat sinew.  The beef that came in the my beef noodle soup came from, I believe, some cut of rib, straight off the bone.  So, although the beef was nice an tender, there were some pieces of sinew that were attached to most of my pieces of meat.  They were mostly tender, but some were a bit chewy.  Some people, like myself, actually enjoy eating these pieces of meat, but for those of you who don't, you might want to order a different kind of noodle soup.    \n\nWe also ordered the pork steamed dumplings and the beef stick.I was not a big fan of the beef stick.  I think the cut of beef they use for the beef stick is not ideal for that type of treatment.  It was overdone, tough, and I wasn't too into the sauce.  I can't quite describe it except that it was a light soy sauce marinade, on the slightly sweet side, with little to no depth.  \n\nThe steam dumplings were okay.  The dumpling skin is not typical; thin and delicate.  Simply based on the skin, they were very \hearty\"" dumplings.  I think they may use the same or similar dough recipe for their dumpling skins as with their noodles.  The filling was okay.  A bit on the mushy side for me and the sauce that they serve with it is lighter in terms of sweetness than most sweet and sour sauces.  \n\nThe staff is very friendly and the prices are very reasonable.\n\nLike my husband said, \""any time I am in the mood for some noodles [Chinese wheat noodles specifically] I am coming here.\""""",i7PynIHb,840

4783,2018-05-13 20:13:58,"I'm new to the Phoenix area and have been to several restaurants  here searching for standouts.  Switch stands out, but not for the best reasons.  I had the Ibiza Sangria Chicken Sandwich.  As soon as it arrived I knew I was in for a let down.  The menu states \roasted chicken\"".  What I got was clumps of soggy compressed deli chicken.  The bread was described as a \""large rustic artisan roll\"".  It was not large...nor was it fresh.  Artisan to me does not mean stale and tough.  But the biggest issue was with what is described on the menu as a \""Caesar salad\"".  There are variations on this dish available for the chef to draw from, however chopped iceberg lettuce with a few bits of romaine thrown in changes the dish into a mixed green salad, not a Caesar.  Also there was no cheese, no croutons, no hint of anchovy, just the mixed lettuces with a Caesar-style dressing glopped on top.  Sloppy, tasteless presentation of the food along with confused descriptions on the menu makes me not want to go back.  Save some money, you can get something similar at Arby's for half the price.""",hTiJWkZ5,4378
4784,2018-04-22 13:08:27,"Narcisse is a funny place because it advertises that being narcissistic is a good thing.  The decor has these decorative, novelty mirrors on the walls because Narcissus, blah blah blah.  Thing is, I don't think they're being ironic or making any sort of comment on society being so shallow, I think it's legitimately like a very \greed is good\"" kind of admission of character.  It's not satire.  It's Scottsdale.\n\nThe color scheme is purple.  Purple, purple everywhere.  As such, I felt like I was in that one scene in Batman (1989) where the Joker poisons everyone and Kim Bassinger has to put on that red gas mask.  I've spent a lot of time describing what the place looks like, much more than I typically do, but I feel like it is an important part of the overall experience of coming here.\n\nLook, for $10, you get bottomless \""bubbles,\"" which... I thought was adorable that they kept saying \""bubbles!\"" but it turns out that at these kinds of places, everyone thinks they're a champagne expert, which is kind of funny because it's $10, so if they don't say bubbles or something adorable, people will get pissed.  If you wanted to have classy sparkling wine, $10 would be the smartest use of money since Steve Jobs invested in Pixar.  There's no need to complain unless you think that your snob muscle is getting flabby.  \n\nEverything else is reasonably priced, too.  My breakfast burrito was pretty damn big and cost something like $9.  Don't get me wrong.  It was bland.  It certainly wasn't bad, but it was like a rough approximation of a breakfast burrito and executed without all the love.\n\nI wouldn't recommend coming here unless your mission, really, is to have a group of people get kind of sauced in the morning and have some laughs, plug your gut with some food and probably pass out a couple hours later by a pool.""",Cr4DFQdI,185

The server was really cute and attentive but she had no clue what to suggest for a non meat eater I was struggling to find anything appealling here. She finally suggested a salad. It was good it had candied walnuts and dried cranberries w goat cheese on it but by the time I got it everyone had eaten and I stole a bunch of their fries so I couldnt eat the whole colassal salad.

In addition, they have Super Mario Brothers of 8-bit Nintendo fame which you can play for a quarter while you wait for your burger.

4795,2018-04-09 10:05:17,"My wife has never been here before so I figured it was about time.  Every Phoenician should go here at least once.  So, last Friday night as a monsoon was \supposed\"" to roll in, we decided to pay the Rooste a visit.\n\nThe parking lot at the top was full so we parked at the bottom.  I wouldn't have minded the walk up but they have a shuttle that will take you so that was nice.  I guess the best way to describe this place is a big western saloon with an awesome view of the city.  Maybe \""saloon\"" doesn't do it much justice but it is all I could think of.  It is just very westerny.\n\nThe place was pretty packed but we didn't mind because it would give us time to check out the place and maybe sit at the bar and get an ice cold Shiner that is on tap.  Well we tried that while waiting for a table but it looked like there was only one bar tender getting drinks for the bar patrons as well as the entire waitstaff for all the tables in the place.  Oh well.  After a few minutes were were seated and yes, we both took the slide down.  Oh, there was also a live band playing some country music and it was pretty good and not overly loud.  If I had a couple more drinks in my I probably would have tried to dance country style. \n\nOur waiter was very nice but some things took forever because the poor guy had like 17 tables.  I don't understand why places can't hire more waitstaff.  I mean they work basically for tips and there are probably plenty of people wanting jobs so wtf?  Anyway, he was very nice and did the best job he could.\n\nI love the Indian fry bread and biscuits they give you to start.  I could eat that stuff all night.  They give you like 3 different kinds of butter and honey to play with so it doesn't get much better than that.\n\nMy wife and I split the bone in rib eye and it was juicy, flavorful and delicious.  It was a bit fatty but that is how I like it.  My wife took the less marbled part so it all worked out.  With an entree you get a nice big salad, beans and corn.  It was all good and was plenty for 2 people.  I would definitely order the steak again but I think next time we are going to share some of their ribs.  I had them years ago and I remember them being very good.\n\nI know some people like it, especially the kids, but I don't like the random guys walking around making balloon animals and others doing magic tricks.  I try not to make eye contact with them so they don't come over because I just want to sit and enjoy my meal.\n\nAnyway, this place is pretty good and perfect to bring out-of-towners because it is very westerny and has a perfect view.  Kids also seem to love the balloon animals, magic, the slide, and the little paper bull horn hats they give them.  Also, when you go, I would recommend sharing your entree.  The amount of meat they give you is more than enough for 2 people. \n\nAlthough a monsoon didn't end up rolling in which would have been nice to watch up there, we had a good time anyway.""",jvHLUSte,1733

I not a huge fan of really thick burgers so this place works for me. The burgers are juicy and they have lots of toppings you can pile on. The 1 and only complaint is this is one of those places that tries to sell you fries separate. Of course they always say - our small order is enough for 2-. This bothers me cause when I go to a fast food type place I'm usually by myself and I need fries for one not fries for 2. Now your $5 burger turns into $10 when adding a drink and fries. So unless your someone that goes here to get a burger and a burger only you will never spend just $5 here. The sad thing is all the fries they are waisting when your forcing one Person to by enough fries for 2. Aside from that the burger is great but unfortunately for $10 burgers these days i can go to so many places like fez and or grinders. This place needs a combo meal for around $7 and I would stop here more often.,wtPteNLD,4609

It is amazing how much better she is doing. She plays soccer about 8 months out of the year so she is constantly being exposed to things she is allergic to and doing a lot of running. She is playing harder than she did last year and I can't help but give Dr. Jorgensen credit where credit is due. The only thing about our initial visit that seemed strange was just how long it took the appointment was taking. I found out before we left that the reason it took so long was because there was a patient having a severe asthma attack that had to be treated right away and then sent to the ER.

There are two menus (that they are happy to explain to you). The \grab and go\"" menu with things like sandwiches and wraps and a \""bistro\"" menu with more hot dinner-type options. Immediately, the owner asked if I wanted free samples. Sure! I ordered the Pork Tenderloin with Morel Cream sauce (I love morels!). My dude friend had the Swedish Meatballs. We sat on our Ikea chairs at our Ikea table and enjoyed ABBA softly playing in the background. I admired the Outsider Art for sale on the walls. I almost wanted to buy the painting of the woman holding a baby. The woman looked like one of the Olsen twins. Neat! The little free samples were yummy. I had a little bit of gravlax with dill sauce, beet salad in sour cream (amazing), potato salad and some kind of lemon mousse thing. All very tasty. My pork schnitzel with the morels was so delicious. It came with salad, coleslaw and mashed potatoes with the same cream sauce. I think that mushroom sauce melted my cold cold heart. It made me smile. Then we ordered the lemon mousse thingy. I said to my friend, \""I wish Dancing Queen would come on.

I wouldn't be so irked if it were a packed restaurant but there was seriously only 1 other table there and I counted at least 4 if not 5 people working there...1 of them could've bothered to check to make sure if we had drinks and/or chips and salsa but obviously that was expecting way too much. Like I said they used to be good but the past few times I've been there their quality has been going down and this last experience was the last straw. Of course they are also very pricey...10.50 for 2 tacos beans and rice and the tacos are SMALL.

4844,2018-02-14 06:34:44,"This is so far the only dog park I've been to ever, so I'm no expert, however, We've been bringing our pit bull mix puppy here almost daily for about a month now. She loves it and we love it! Now from what I've read it's no doggy Disneyland, but it's more about the other dogs and people for her to play with than having a lake, considering she hates water! We always bring her in the Large Dog Area (for dogs over 20lbs.), but don't worry, there's a separate place for Fifi too. Both dog parks seem to just have a covered picnic table and a couple trees and then the watering station in the corner. Which now is cement and has a drain so it's not a muddy mess, which it appears may have been a problem in the past. The people who come regularly are pretty nice and everybody knows everybody and everyone else's dogs. Most everyone, especially the regulars are really good about picking up after their dogs and reminding others when it's \their turn\"". Most people are really good about knowing when dogs are \""just playing\"" and when it turns aggressive. We're trying to teach our puppy to not get vocal when she plays so if she growls or barks we'll call her off or pull her away until she calms down; at times we've even called her off for play growling and people have said \""oh she's fine.\"" So most people don't seem to be overly sensitive and know to let dogs be dogs. Most everyone is pretty good about calling their dogs off when they're trying to, if I may quote the Newlywed Game, \""make whoopie\"" with other dogs as well. The only thing I wish is that other people wouldn't be afraid to discipline my dog instead of taunting her. For example, she has a fascination with those tennis ball thrower things, no interest in the ball itself, just the thrower. She always tries to grab them when people are throwing and my boyfriend an I always correct her, but then the guy throwing it starts taunting her with it and waiving it in her face. Not helpful when you are trying to train a puppy!!!! Finally my boyfriend had to ask if he could have it for a minute so that he could claim it from her and correct her if she tried to grab it. I'm sure some people get offended if you push their dog away when it jumps on you because he's \""just saying hi\"", and I'm not saying your should just turn your dog loose and leave it for other people to train, or haul off and smack someone dog because he drools on you, but it takes a whole village to raise a puppy sometimes and if you see someone trying to correct a behavior in their dog, help them out by reinforcing it, don't augment their problem! Also, a warning, occasionally there are two small mud puddles that develop. Luckily our dog isn't interested in them because it involves water, so it's always entertaining to see the biggest, whitest fluffiest dog go over to the puddle and see the owner running over and yelling \""Noooooooooooo!!!!) in slow motion as their white dog lays down and rolls over in the puddle. So, bring a towel in case Snowball decides he's hot and needs to go for a dip! So, ALLLLL of that being said, it's a great place to go and let her wear herself out for an hour without wearing us out, and it's a nice place for us to meet some of the people in the community. I think we're going to go there now as a matter of fact.""",vBUE9npc,3080

Salsa \""tasty\"". \n\nI like the 2 or 3 combo option on the menu. Lots of items to choose from. I tried the shredded chicken and beef tacos (served with rice and refried beans). Shells were homemade but a little greasy. My husband went with the shrimp enchiladas ($13.99). Nothing special and expensive. \n\nThe have a long list of margaritas including their \""Kick-Ass Tex-Ass\"" topped with a shot of beer. During happy hour (3 to 6:30) most margaritas are $5.99. Although that may seem like a good deal don't be fooled because the glass is filled to the brim with ice. \n\nOverall kind of pricey for a Mexican restaurant and not all that impressed with the quality of the food.

4883,2018-01-10 18:10:14,"It's such an insult when you go to a place that's got amazing potential, but you find that the proprietor's idea of a music venue is worse than a whore's idea of intimacy.  They must think that a bulk of monitors pointed at the cement floor and the misty stench of beer kegs is all it takes to make something special.  Good lord.  The sound guy(s) there likely couldn't distinguish the simple sound of a chiming six-string from a herd of farting stray cats.  They make the vocals sound as though it's all one 30 minute sustaining blur, the bass sound like you happened to catch Chanting Monks Night, and the snare sound like a plastic spoon hitting a mound of mashed potatoes.\n\nMe and a couple pals laughed ourselves silly during the last show that we attended there, after watching about 5 guys distract the crowd with their scurrying about to wrestle with one rack of lights... only to have each light end up being pointed at the bottom of the entry door at the left side of the hall.  Watching those \technicians\"" all walk away giving each other hi-fives and thumbs-up just about caused me to laugh up my pancreas onto the floor.  Downright hilarious.\n\nThe parking arrangement is stupid, to put it plain and simple.  The venue is about the size of a 2-screen movie theater, with about 30 parking spaces available.  Really.  They actually place orange traffic cones and a couple guys out there to direct parking,\n\nIt's all about as asinine as equipping a straw with an engine.\n\nLast little tidbit for all you folks out there who've gotten fed up with their security, and rightfuilly so: after experiencing a type of harrassment attitude from security one of my female friends civily acknowledged to their door staff that the club's ability to manage their security staff is in error, along with a public safety risk present within the venue were both matters enough to halt operation then and in the future.  Thus, my friend was obliged with about 5 free shows at the venue.\n\nSound still sucked though, as I was told.""",wugo2Sgj,4091

4892,2018-02-26 00:58:30,"Lack of organization and thought for the customers.\n\nGoldfield has plenty of parking and is free to enter, however you must pay to enter any of the attractions (museum, mine, bordello, mystery shack, train tour, reptiles, etc). As well there are tip jars all over the place.\n\nWe purchased their multi-pack which gave us tickets for the train ride, mystery shack and mine tour. I think it saved us $3-5 on an adult admission (I seem to think it was $16/adult). We purchased our pack at the train station, where there are also public washrooms available. There are some in town but seem to be lined up ALL the time.\n\nWe boarded the train for a tour around the city, which I highly recommend doing first. It gives you a little bit of an idea of what is all in Goldfield and an entertaining ride (if you get a good conductor). I believe the train ride takes 20-30 minutes in total. \n\nWe then went to the mine tour, which was excellent. Our guide was very, very entertaining. He did make one little girl scared of the elevator ride (other children were fine), however as someone with no children present I found him very entertaining. The mine tour itself is excellent, it gives you an idea of what went on in the mines and our guide put it over the top. He was very entertaining and humourous throughout the whole tour. The only complaint I have is that they take down a large group and if you want to take pictures of something you need to be at the front of the line or else the lights might be turned off before you get a chance (they are turned on in sections and as you are leaving the section turned off).\n\nWe then went to the Mystery Shack. We soon learned the extent of how poorly things are run. You can only have 12 people in at a time (they sometimes allow more, our guide told us whoever could stand on the concrete pad at the far left would get in) and there is no system in place to indicate who was waiting the longest. I would highly recommend sitting close to that concrete pad. We waited, and found out in 10 minutes that there were too many people ahead of us and given the option of waiting there another 20 minutes or coming back later and our guide would \remember us\"". Well, we decided to come back later. And still couldn't get on. Then we tried a third time and the tour was filled with people the guide \""remembered\"" so we couldn't get on. Overall I think this was the worst part of the day as we had paid for the Mystery Shack as part of our pass but couldn't get on unless we waiting there at least 20 minutes longer, then hope no one who the guide \""remembered\"" bumped us off.\n\nInside of the town we went to the Bordello and got lucky with a small group. As we were leaving a large group was entering, and it wouldn't have been nearly the same. The Bordello was rather small with a couple bedrooms but was entertaining. The guide was informative and answered all of our questions. It's $3 a person, but adds a little bit of interest to the day. I'm sure it could be child friendly as there is nothing inside the house itself that isn't, and anything that isn't child friendly is really what questions people may ask.\n\nThe gunfight was a little cheesy with the storyline, but still entertaining. I don't think it's worth it to see just for that, however it's nice to have a different type of entertainment mixed in.\n\nThe bakery was delicious and the baked goods seemed reasonably priced. They also offers some sandwiches and such if you don't want to go to the saloon. The gifts shops are just that, gift shops. Nothing special or out of the ordinary. We did not see the reptiles or \""museum\"" based on previous reviews.\n\nOverall I thought Goldfield was an interesting way to spend an afternoon. I was very disappointed in the lack of organization with the Mystery Shack and that's what brings this down a little (rating wise).""",3MXZolSA,1832

4943,2018-04-18 09:18:24,"I really love Cheuvront's.  I think it's really underrated.    I've never had a bad food, beverage or service experience, and I've been many, many times.\n\nOne of the things I love to do at Cheuvront's is the tastings.   Wine tastings, cheese classes, beer tastings... it's all yummy, PLUS super-fun, and very informative too.\n\nCheuvronts has been through a couple of different chefs, but the food is always consistently made from ultra fresh, premium ingredients.  My favorites include just about any salad on the menu, and the salmon, mmmm.    \n\nThe cheese selection is, bar none, the best in Phoenix metro.   I didn't say it was the cheapest; but it is definitely the best selection of some of the most fantastic cheeses I've ever had. \n\nI highly recommend going to a cheese class to learn more about cheeses!   Ken Cheuvront is extremely knowledgeable and has travelled to most of the places where the cheese is made and has personally met most of the cheese makers.   So that makes for some great stories which make you appreciate the cheese even more.\n\nThere are great happy hour deals on both food (starters) and beverages, and on Sundays and Mondays the happy hour prices go ALL DAY.   Unbelievable deal! \n\n(Btw:  I don't understand what this means from other reviews: \it wants to be more hip than it really is\""?  Huh?   I think the decor is great - cool, breezy, comfortable.   Is it hip?  I dunno.   And I sure don't know what \""trying to be hip\"" looks like.)

4955,2018-03-08 02:21:50,"Had dinner with five friends here. Four of us arrived and had a cocktail at the bar. We were seated after a 10 minute wait. Someone came by the table to greet us as soon as we were seated but we weren't sure if he was the waiter or not. He said bread was on the way (but we didn't see it till 20 minutes later) and gave us some menus.\n\nWe sat for nearly 10 minutes waiting for our waiter and no one showed up. I also want to note that the restaurant wasn't too busy on a Friday night (perhaps this review will explain why). One of my buddies asked another waiter for our server. The same guy who greeted us came back and said he was our waiter. I am not going to say his name as I don't want our country's unemployment rate to go up. The waiter made excuses on why he didn't come back. Whatever...\n\nOne of my buddies who's a wine connoisseur ordered a 2007 Syrah and the waiter brought out a 2008 instead. We politely sent it back. My buddy followed with another 2007 Cabernet and we again received the 2008 instead. How hard is it to update the wine menu? There's a huge difference in wine when it comes to the year. How can a \famous\"" steakhouse have such an oversight on the menus.\n\nAll of our appetizers came before we could order the wine. Luckily we were still drinking our house wine and cocktails we ordered from the bar. Just about when we finished our appetizers, we got our bread. Really? What's the point?\n\nWe settled on the 2008 Cabernet and had to ask for a decanter. The waiter didn't know what it was and later came back with one. \n\nI ordered the dinner special which was $50 for a soup or salad, follow by a main course and dessert. The soup was a bit salty but acceptable. I got the filet as a main. The meat was ok. Not great. I didn't like the fact that they put sour cream and raspberry sauce on the filet. If it was a good meat, no sauces are necessary. The best part of my meal was the dessert which was a warm bread pudding. \n\nMy other three buddies' all ordered steaks a la carte. Of the three steaks, only one was good -- ribeye. For the other steaks which were $40+, I don't think it met our expectations. You can certainly head down the road to Ruth's Chris or Delfrisco for a similar steak. I personally would head back to Tarbell's which is also down the road.\n\nOverall, the meal was so so at best. Not worth the price. The service here was horrendous.""",rhwZrTEf,2686

A disappointment, again. \n\nI was too late for lunch and the same old bartender had the same old line while I listened to the same old music from the same old guitar player. OK, so the guitar player is the BEST thing this place has to offer. \n\nLast time I was there, the bartender also was the cook and the waiter while the owner stood at the end of the bar and sipped from his \water\"" pitcher. \n\nCome on now, Cowboy. Saddle up and give us something new on a Sunday afternoon. How 'bout a coupla Cowgirls serving beer and nibbles that don't stop at 4pm.

4959,2018-05-07 03:57:29,"Ever since this place opened up while I was attending ASU, I've always been tempted to try it out. But my recent visit to Phoenix for birthday related festivities, and my new favorite TV show, Man vs. Food, inspired me to step up to the challenge!\n\nMy first visit to the Heart Attack Grill, I had to tackle the 8,000 calorie, Quadruple Bypass Burger; in honer of Adam and food challengers everywhere!\n\nFirst things first, the establishment is a riot! I can't picture people NOT having fun there. The outfits, the blood pressure machine, the margaritas... The atmosphere is incredibly fun.\n\nI had to get an order of their \Flat-Liner\"" Fries... never tasted deep friend lard before. But to be honest, I wasn't impressed. The photo on the menu made them look a lot more appetizing then I felt they were. I've had better for a lot fewer calories... but because you get UNLIMITED Flat-Liner Fries, I'm still satisfied.\n\nBut the hamburger... Amazing! One of the best hamburgers I've tasted! Despite the size of this 2 lb. beast, I was able to wrap my jaws around it and take some full bites. Delicious! Cheese drips everywhere and flavor just explodes in your mouth.\n\nI was victorious with the challenge, despite being slow with time (took me 25 minutes... I heard the record is 1 min. 47 sec.). It definitely was a challenge. The first 10 minutes were cheese burger heaven. But by the end of the meal I was tired of eating, changing the flavor of hamburger with the occasional tomato or pickle (also, an excellent condiment bar to build your burger how ever you like it). But I persevered, and I was happily removed from the building by my sexy waitress Nurse Mary in a wheel chair.\n\nA thanks goes out to my friend Amberly who joined me and gave me support when I was slowing down. Her optimism definitely helped me finish this race.\n\nNext time, I will definitely order a smaller burger...""",fJ3QZGbt,2767

This place is a best-kept secret and it's as inviting as any neighborhood bar but also very retro.  Old movies play in the background and the friendly bar staff serves up excellent martini's and specialty drinks.  The White Rabbit martini is a favorite of mine and is very similar to that of horchatta. Great deejays perform in this little spot and I love that it attracts a very diverse and friendly Phoenix crowed.  This is definitely a favorite spot of mine and I would recommend this to anyone who appreciates hip local spots.  \n\nSundays are industry night and,xAql7KWT,4935

The staff is always courteous, the food always comes out in a timely manner, although I will note, when dinning with a group some times food comes to the table over the course of 5 to 10 minutes.  I have also noticed that things aren't always \hot\"" when they get to you.  Other than those minor issues, Sauce is the perfect place for a quick lunch with colleagues or after an afternoon of power shopping. I recommend their Veggie Salad with the gorgonzola dressing (it doesn't come with the salad so you have to ask  for it by name!).""",aWYEyJwN,3642
4965,2018-03-31 20:12:57,"Yes, just about every free-standing bar (meaning one that's not part of a hotel or something) tries to claim sports-bar status by littering their walls with big-screen TV's and tuning each to some different game. Well . . . see . . . anyone can do that, which is why it's popular. To make a REAL sports bar you need a management who develops sports as the raison d'etre of the place itself. And yes, I just used a fancy French phrase to philosophize about a sports bar.\n\nHazelwood's not only has large TV's on almost every vertical surface, they have TV's at every booth, just like truck stops in the old days had mini-jukeboxes. \n\nHazelwood's has good bar-fare at good prices on their menu, but also impressive specials that are only in effect during games. One of their beer specials when I visited was Widmer Hefeweizen. How often do you see that on special in other places?\n\nHazelwoods's not only welcomes local amateur sports teams, they sponsor a few, like the local rugby guys.\n\nHazelwoods will not only call you a cab if you over-imbibe, they also will shuttle you home in their own shuttle craft for free within a reasonable distance. This is putting their money within reasonable distance of their mouth, if you ask me.\n\nBut what is most important--and is most likely a result of the policies and features above--is the customer base. When I go into a sports bar and sit at the bar I want the guys next to me--strangers who just happen to be sitting there--to occasionally lean over and say in breathless excitement while staring me in the eye \THE DIFFERENCE IN TIME OF POSSESSION IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE GAME WAS LESS THAN 5 MINUTES BETWEEN NEW YORK AND INDY!\"" Seriously, this is important to me because just as people in a dancing bar should be fully involved with dancing, people in a sports bar should be fully involved with sports. And I find such running commentary helpful because I basically don't know shit about football.\n\nAlso, on the night I was there the rugby players were entertaining the whole bar with their profane gang-sings about necrophilia and such. This further contributed to the integrity of the impression. This is a sports bar full of sporty people.\n\nSo yes, Hazelwood's is a success and deservedly so. This is a SPORTS BAR. It's not an Applebee's, nor is it a dive with a lot of TV's. If you enjoy the spirit of the rabid spectator and can share the excitement of those who thrill to vicarious participation, you should go to this place.""",DdJxbuci,4173

I was a little annoyed because I had to wait (there was a \be back soon\"" sign on the door, which was adorable, but irritating). But, you know, it's Wednesday afternoon and there's only one girl working. Fine. Then, upon entering, she really was not very warm or welcoming. I feel that every store should treat each guest that walks through their doors as though they can afford to buy the entire place. She basically acted like I was not there, as she was busy steaming a dress. They carry some great brands (Tibi, Milly, Poleci) and have some fun clothes....however, it is all on the pricier end. Some of the tops were $250 or so, which is a bit much for a tank top even if you are made of money. I found the selection a bit scattered...some of it was either way too trendy or just a little odd - the kind of clothes that you hesitate to spend money on because they aren't staples and are going to look absurd in 3 months. However, the brands are solid and the selection is vast (and they have Hanky Pankies - woo hoo)....so I will likely stop in again. However, I will always go to Croll Blue first.""",y1mPIMAc,3695

4992,2018-03-18 19:31:41,First of all - very clean nail salon without any overpowering smell. I am a hair stylist by trade and so I am VERY particular about sanitation in salons. This place seemed to follow all the rules to protect their guests. Secondly,UouNtS6z,4728
4993,2018-03-01 07:01:22,"I used to pass this place all the time, thinking it was just some restaurant built in a former Denny's or something like that.  Turns out it's a pretty good bar.  They have a lot of great stuff on tap, lots of special drinks all the time, special drinking events, beer reps giving away stuff, etc.  If you're looking to drink cheap, they've got PBR and such, but you'll be hard pressed to see it in stock there.  The food's pretty good, especially the pizza.   Different specials every day (e.g., Mondays are 1/2 off pizza and Tuesdays are 1/2 off appetizers).  Trivia on Tuesdays and Saturday (very crowded).  The atmosphere is good.  The place is named for and geared for climbers, so you'll see them and various types of hipsterish people, but it's not like Casey Moore's or anything.\n\nGet one of their \Summit Society\"" cards and you can get some deals.  And the Big Ass Nachos are huge.  Every time I get some, I eat the leftovers for a day or two.""",T0zyKVYO,4273

4995,2018-05-30 12:07:51,"I recently got my little baby pug Penny from a private breeder, so I wanted to take her to a vet and get her checked out. Animal Care Hospital was close to my house, so I figured I would give it a try. \n\nThey were able to see me SAME DAY, which was an awesome treat. I was afraid I would have to wait several days for my new puppy exam and the medical guarantee from the breeder was only good for one week.\n\nAnyways, the vets office was conveniently located, the office is clean, the staff is friendly and everyone was in love with Penny. (it's hard not to be.. I know I am a proud mommy, but she really is adorable!)\n\nI sat down and filled out my paperwork and they took me back right away. The vet, Dr. Temple, was extremely friendly and thorough and answered all my questions. I signed up for the \puppy package\"" that basically takes you through all of the shots they need for the first few months, wellness exams, fecal test and a microchip and also includes a start up of heartworm preventer.\n\nPenny had her second set of shots the day prior when I purchased her from the breeder, but for some reason Dr. Temple gave her another set. She told me there was nothing to worry about but they didn't charge me, so I think she may have made a mistake. Penny was fine and she told me that it would not cause any problems, but I'm glad that she didn't make a mistake on something life threatening. (This is the only reason I am not giving ACHS five stars.)\n\nWe went back three weeks later for our third set of shots and got in immediately. They were quick, friendly and efficient again and able to provide me with some suggestions on how to curb Miss Penny's biting habits.\n\nThe only issues I have encountered were with the billing. I think that the puppy package confuses the billing girls a little, because both times I went in they had to make adjustments. Not a big deal, they took care of everything and refunded the incorrect amount immediately, I just hope it doesn't keep happening.\n\nOh, another really cool feature is that your pet gets a login and you can keep track of service records through the vet. They have some cool features on the website where you can fill out forms for someone babysitting your pet and you can post pictures and put in information about the diet. I know I lose papers all the time, so its great to have all of Penny's records online where I can easily access them.\n\nThey have awesome hours... so I can get in after work, and the location is convenient for me. They also sell different types of food and hygiene supplies there, so you can pick up stuff for your animal should you need to.\n\nI would definitely recommend this Vet's office to anyone. Knowledgeable and Friendly staff!""",iqi1sTxY,778
